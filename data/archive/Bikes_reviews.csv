Bajaj Platina 110,4,its good as compare to price,4,It is good as compare to its price . I will sugges you all to take this product becouse it is to ride and other features like milege and very easy to oprate the bike in this range i will say this is the best product Its design is just fab. The seat is pretty comfortable. It can be easily handled and controlled. Its not much heavy as well.The brakes are pretty decent too.The engine also is quite good. It gives mileage of 60kmpl. Bike is very good for daily commuting.  Only maintenance is a disadvantage. Best fuel efficient bike in this category.It is a Economical bike because its prize is very low.A fight till the end of petrol. Platina is 4 stroke bike and 100 cc engine. Platina is not good looking bike and not very comfortable.The look of this bike is not good. One of the best fuel efficient bikes that comes in budget which is under. A good thing about platina is we can rely on it in a long trip as it’s actually too comfortable for ridingIt has a good suspension
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Best in mileage,4,Bought it 5 years ago.
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Good bike platina,4,This is best bike ever  .of bajaj and this give the great average of the 85 km\g 
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Bike with great mileage,2,"Bajaj is one of the valuable bike manufacturer  who build bike with  great mileage (80 Kmph).The price of the bike is lower compared to other bike in market. Never expect a great pulling from the 100 CC Platina. But even a single person can ride with comfortable.Service cost of the bike is less compared to other bikes of same manufacturer. You can trust Bajaj  Platina as you need a bike with good mileage. I need to change the speedometer and cables after 15,000 Kms. of running. Also need to change the Chain and Sprocket after 25,000 Kms of running. No other spare parts replacement come in my usage. The tyres come with alloy wheels. If you  use  bike   daily for going office or other work the bike never steal your pocket. If you are living in Hill area, I never suggest this bike for your use because its engine power is lower . The manufacturer focused mainly in mileage  and not in power.  The bike with Trailing arm with co- axial hydraulic shockabsorber is not so bad. It has 11L petrol tank."
Bajaj Platina 110,4,bajaj platina bike review,5,"I had used more than 8 to 10 bike  during different road conditions but the bajaj platina was top amongst all other bike because of fuel efficiency and load carrying capacity .The new Bajaj Platina ES comes equipped with a 102cc, four-stroke, single cylinder engine that is naturally cooled by air. The new motorcycle is equipped with a thumb-starter that does not require the clutch to be engaged when cranking, and does so with no fuss at all, to settle into a quiet idle.s model is known for its best design .The Platina ES is long and sleek in the flesh, with a refreshed front fascia that it largely carries forward from the regular Platina. But overall, the ES is almost completely redesigned. The bright red motorcycle provided to us looked smart in the flesh. Its front cowl is reworked to form a solid panel now - the black visor seen on the previous model has been dropped. Protected by the cowl is an old school, all-analogue instrument panel, displaying a speedometer, odometer and a fuel gauge via twin chrome-rimed meters. Handle grips are soft to touch and are of decent quality, so are the black levers. Mirrors work well to provide a broad view of the approaching traffic. The well-curved fuel-tank has a filler-cap hinge provided for convenience. Moving on, a long, flattish and dual-tone saddle is provided with a grippy seat-cover for the rider and pillion. Body-coloured grab handle make way here."

Bajaj Platina 110,4,What a bike in these days. clearly money saver.,4,This bike is the bestest bike. I mean which bike can give milage like this one. When my father gifted me this bike on my 19 birthday i was full of surprise that time. That time i thought that this bike is not the best and it is ok for me but when i start riding on this bike i mean what a felling came even i can't mention. Wow this bike is the father of all bikes in milage.No tension of filling the fuel again and again. I remeber when my father and i often goes to amritsar on this bike we just fill our petrol tank with 1.5 litres of petrol and this bike does not need even 1.5 litres.When we return we often see about 0.5 litre of petrol left in the petrol tank.Now  a days petrol and diesel prices prices are rising day by day and with this bike you don't have any tension about petrol prices . Thankyou a and my main opinion for this bike is the mileage.
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Bajaj Platina-Review,5,I have purchased Bajaj Platina on November 2014. It is the best bike with great mileage and great comfort level. I am living in Ahmedabad and traffic is very much in my city. I have purchased it on EMI from nearby Dealer. Below are the pros and Cons of Bajaj Platina Bike.
Bajaj Platina 110,4,satisfied with platina...,4,"i amreall satisfied with this bike.Bajaj Platina is a mileage bike with 96 kmp which is really commendable.t supports both self start and kick start both.ir is very much user friendly. Overall it is a good bike considering the price and can be a best choice for one who are looking for lightweight, easy to handle and a mileage bike."
Bajaj Platina 110,4,A Good Bike But It Depends.....,3,"My experience is that this is good if you are 1. maintaining it well (dont go on low maintainece cost as suggested by many like 1800 in four years). Timely oil change and servicing will do good. 2. In one hand - you share it with many guys and the result will be not far. I required engine work at 38000 km only, because I handed the keys to many guys over this period.   No doubt with guys on this forum who rode 60-70000 kms and happy because this is really good. Fuel wise very economical. In initial days, before 1st service, it was giving mileage around 90 kmpl. But very soon it comes around 60. after 2 servicing I say. I spent a lot of time, I remember, in bajaj service centre, arguing, why it cant give a mileage now what it was before, but to no avail. If you are lucky and maintaining it in true way, may be you can get 70 also.  :-( Disadvantage:- very light weight, I remember times, when I turned more than 90 degree when I applied sudden brakes. But again, you will not expect it to be behave like a sporty bike, so I close this point. After I purchased this bike, I rode a lot Hero bikes, Splendour and Passion. After that the general observation I make is that you should not go for a 100 cc bike first. Even if you go, take splendour. As I see, all bajaj bikes makes a kir-kir sound whereas the Hero bikes make a sound of drum. Pickup and silken touch of excellerator another good thing of Hero’s bikes and Brakes are also good. After a couple of years of bachelorhood spent  with this Platina, and after marriage also, as a normal office goer guy who also carries his wife on pillion riding, I would suggest go for a 125 cc not bajaj bike. Passion is a great bike. We saw a lot of 100 CC bikes but all are failed and wherever exist, gives a pity look. like CT-100, TVS-Victor etc, Platina has not met that fate, but you cant say for how long. Hero Honda earliest CD-100 SS was a good bike, but the remodelled CD100 looking small built like Yamaha was a big flop. Go for 125 cc bike, and that too not from Bajaj. Bajaj’s strength in market is due to Pulsar."
Bajaj Platina 110,4,good avg bike bajaj platina,4,"Dear Concern i am using bajaj platina 100 cc bike last 6 year and no dought it's performance is very good and cost effective,low maintenance high average bike for lower distance it's create problem when we going for travel long distance due to engine quality not so good as my expectation  but mileage is very good so that according to me at this price very good bike It gives a strong pick in third gear with a single rider while with two rider on 2nd gear. It also works with automatic transmission which can control the bike by simple acceleration and a brake. The rear and front drum brakes can bring the bike under perfect control in any riding mode. The bike gives a decent mileage of around 60 kmpl but can gain 75-80 kmpl by third service. Under standard test conditions of the manufacturer, it obtains 108 kmpl.The entry level bike Bajaj Platina 100cc was launched as the cheapest bike in its segment to compete with Hero Honda. Since its launch the bike has got popularity among the buyers both in India and outside due to its reduced cost and presentation. The bike has many executions like body panels, fairings, and electronics, similar to former Bajaj Wind 125. Platina 100cc has been in great demand by the customers for its gorgeous style, stunning performance, outstanding mileage and negligible expenses in its range. The bike attracts the youngsters giving them a suitable personal choice for their daily commute."
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Best For workers,4,"suspension of the Platina is absolutely impressive. seat is pretty comfortable even on a prolonged ride and long enough to seat two comfortably.the bike comfortably cruises at 50-60 km/hr, though overtaking does need some planning. The vibrations from the engine are well contained.the Platina ES is well priced and with the high fuel efficiency, is a good value for money product too."
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Platina,3,"The platina is a bike with a slim look and it is a useful to ride free. It is a bike with a excellent mialage. it is also used for a family's and also for a youth . it is a bike of different colours like red,white and etc.. It is a bike of very weight less and a  easy of going . A rider must feels a comfort of riding the bike of any way  with a long or a short distances . A bike carry's a 3 members in a seat comforts a free space. A bike should over goes a smooth sound it is a comfort to a rider when he rides a bike in the way of long travels and in a easy way . Now you of a every one must think in a way to buy a bike to ride in a easy of a way to a ride. So u can now to a very less cost for a bike to buy in a show room . A new bike make you a joy of a ride with in a roads ."

Bajaj Platina 110,4,SUPERB MILEAGE,4,Bajaj platina is one of the great mileage bike in India. Easy handling and riding. More comfortable seat. Low maintenance and cost efficient. All the automobiles part are easily available in market and after sale service is also good. My bike mileage is 65-70 in city and 75-80 on highway. Fuel tank capacity is also good 12 litre. And  looks is good. Five gear box and self start.

I am not much happy with the braking system of the bike and wish for some improvement in it."
Bajaj Platina 110,4,my experience of bajaj platina .,4,"I have 3 bikes bajaj platina ,hero honda and suzuki.  But I like bajaj platina bike from its some good things and some other things of this bike make me disappoint when i ride it  So  i want to share here about my bajaj platina bike experience and its some bad and good things :-"
Bajaj Platina 110,4,awsome bike ..,5,"Bajaj Platina is a mileage bike with 96 kmpl. It comes with a 102 cc engine.It has a torque of 5000 rpm and power of 7500 rpm. This bike has 4 speed transmission with a top speed of 90 km/hr. It has a fuel capacity of 11 litres. It does not have disk brakes. It supports both self start and kick start.It is available in black, red and blue color. Overall it is a good bike considering the price and can be a best choice for one who are looThe stubby handlebar is accompanied with the never before soft handgrips, I wonder why Bajaj is not giving this small but very crucial feature in all of their bikes. I personally never like the hard plasticky handgrips of all Bajaj bikes including KTM Dukes. The new Platina also has forward set footpegs, which with plush long seat and soft handgrips actually make your ride very comfortable in both the Worlds.king for lightweight, easy to handle and a mileage bike.In our acceleration tests, it managed the sprint to 60kmph in 8.28 seconds and went on to a top speed of 87.1kmph.I am stratified Bajaj Platina 100es motorcycles I Love My Platina motorcycles my life."
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Bajaj Platina The Cheapest Bike.,3,"I had brought this bike in the year 2008, because i did not have that much capital at time time so in 40k the only bike available is bajaj platina. The bike has 100cc engine, alloy wheels, analogue speedometer, kick start. As all know this mileage mention is of 100kmpl which is true, which make it cost worthy in this period of increasing petrol prices, The major drawback i got in this bike is it is very light weight because of which it becomes impossible for the bike to gain speed, yes it has good mileage but poor speed also, After three to two years its engine starts making sound which indirectly means that you have to start saving some money for the bike every year. So although it is the cheapest bike but the quality is also very cheap. Now a days lot more other bikes are available in the market at same price, So i suggest you to got to some other option in 40k bikes or add some more money and buy a good one, because its better to invest money at once instead of investing every year."
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Bajaj Platina the best low budget bike ever ,4,I am using Bajaj Platina since last three months. I like it because it is Cheap in price and also give a very good mileage which is not possible with other bikes in this price range. It has comfortable seat and which is long enough so two or three people can sit easily without any problem. The new look of head is also a killer feature which I liked. The most important thing is that it can run about 90 km in one litre of fuel. That's the mileage is not just good it is the best. The only thing that I have faced that if we load something heavy article or goods on it then it doesn't perform too good. It has nice engine. AND now it also coming with many features. It ride well on roads well built means it is not too good for rural areas. But since it is cheaper and gives good mileage so I will recommend it if one has low budget and want to buy a new bike then it is the best. It looks stylish than other brands bikes in this price range. 
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Awesome bike,4,"Me and my father used bajaj platina bike continuously for two years. Petrol consumption in this bike is very low.Engine of this bike is very awesome. Look of the bike is average but new models of this bike is very awesome.seats of this bike is average in compare of other costly brand bikes.This bike is not compatible for running at 100 km per hour.service of this bike is very awesome.For a normal family,this type of fuel compatible bike is very good.we send this bike for servicing after 5-6 months.After servicing,performance of bike is awesome. But my bike is not self started.so we can't say it a smooth experience but instead of this ,my bike is start in a low kick.It is a very good thing.Clutch of bike is not so hard.in the end,my bike is very awesome and I love it .miledge of bike and average is unbeatable."

The company's cheapest offering the Platina 100 - however, is doing good business, but it sales have been constantly dropping due to high demand for Hero Splendor, HeroPassion and Hero's Dream series. To counter its rivals, Bajaj has now launched the 2015 ES Electric Start variant that is claimed to be the 'World's Mileage Championwering the Platina ES is a new 102cc singlecylinder with Bajaj's DTSi technology and ExhausTEC. The similar engine also powers the Discover 100M, but in a higher state of tune 9bhp and 9.02Nm. In the case of Platina ES, the engine is tuned to return 8bhp and 8.7Nm.In terms of design, it looks largely similar to the current Platina except for new side panels, new exhaust, slightly different headlamp design and new graphics."

Bajaj Auto recently hopped on to the right path by launching two motorcycles - the Platina ES and the refreshed CT100 - in the entry-level segment, not only to offer variety, but also to cater to this vast market."
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Superb and cost saving,5,"My platina is gifted me by my father, that is the first reason why I love it most. Also if we talk about mileage it is one of the best bike I have ever seen.We can seat comfortably and enjoy the ride.Even in emergency it has helped me to hospitalise my friend.As we know long seat is very useful to carry something with one person.My platina gives average of 80 which saves my transportation cost which is nowadays too costly.it is 5 years I have been using platina and not a single time it made me sad or upset, not a single complaint.In other words platina is super and duper for my biking experience.As we see craze of bikes is tremendous, youngsters use to buy costly bikes which are not so affordable.So as to conclude this is one of the best bike in my life."
Bajaj Platina 110,4,bajaj platina bike experience,5,"I had purchased my bajaj platina in 2006 and had done the periodical service without fail from bajaj authorized service center till 2010. By the beginning of 2011 my bike engine started to create unwanted sounds and it become so unbearable that I needed to take to the service center. After the service I had driven it for two days and the sound produced by the bike is like some hammering sound on a metal sheet. I took it back to the service person and they charged me Rs 11, 000.00 for the engine work. I asked them why such an issue had happened as I am spending exorbitant money for the last four years to service my bike at the authorized center(almost Rs 12, 000 in total for a distance of 30, 000 kilometer). They just told me that the reason is some manufacturing defects. My question is that if there is some manufacturing defects then why cant they rectify it themselves. Why shoul they pass on the burden to the customers. However now the bile is in running condition, but not as smooth as earlier. Giving a mileage of 60 km. In the last 6 year I almost spent the cost of the bike itself to maintain the bike in a good condition within a total travel done below 40, 000 K.M. just pausing it as now for buying a new bike minimum I have to pay 70K+."
Bajaj Platina 110,4,The super saver bike,1,Bajaj platina is one of the best bike of the bajaj company. Some special features make it a good bike. 1st of all it comes in less price which is affordable. It consumes less oil & save the money. Model's look is also good . basically it is one of the best bike for the middle class family and for those who travel more. This bike have enough long seat. 
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Good for mielage lover..,4,"The style is not good for them who need good mileage  and easy to ride they can select this bike. this bike gives approx 90 kmpl mileage because it is 100 cc engine and the developers of bajaj company invented this bike for mileage lovers.And this bike seat is too long the people who ride triple riding or the family can sit with very comfort. and this bike cost is very cheap its starting price is 40000 and It’s a comfortable motorcycle.This bike is useless for the people who go long drives because its engine is just 100 cc capacity and suspenssion is not so good. The fuel tank has a capacity of 11.5 litres. its engine is DTS  and powerful self start,I'm using this bike since 2009 and yet to point out a heavy flaws about this bike. Only the looks is a bit pathetic and very less weight bike Are the disadvantage.I suggests all mileage lover to buy this bike and its is the one and only bike who gives you a better performance and good for your money"
Bajaj Platina 110,4,good for daily user,4,I had brought my platina in 2011 because i need bike for my daily use for my mobile business i think it has many qualities but one of the major advantage is that it has very good milage which is its best point it also comfortable for all kind of persons but major disadvatage is that it is very light weight and sometime it slip on the road but overaall it is good bike i like it

Bajaj Platina 110,4,Nice bike at cheap cost,4,Hello everyone…..My name is Shailesh gupta from Gujarat. I have been riding Bajaj platina from last 4 Years and I am here to share to my experiences about platina so that it might be helpful for anyone. 
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Bajaj Platina ,4,Hi friends…..I have been riding Bajaj Platina for last 2 years and i am satisfied with its performance
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Bajaj Platina,3,Hello friends!! 
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Bajaj Platina,3,"Hi… I am putting this review to share my experiences with Bajaj Platina. I  had purchased my bajaj platina in 2006 and had done the periodical service without fail from bajaj authorized service center till 2010. By the beginning of next year my bike engine started to create unwanted and undesirable noise. After that I took my bike to service centre but they did not resolve the trouble.  After the service I had driven it for two days and the sound produced by the bike is like some hammering sound on a metal sheet. So at last I take my bike to the local service centre, they charged me Rs 8000 for engine work. The local service center personnel disassemble the whole engine and rectify the problem. After the engine problem solved, the chain set started unwanted noise. Within the four years of using, it had many problem and several parts are tends to be changed. But the mileage of Bajaj platina is near 80 kmpl. All the other parts including suspension, handling and gripping are very nice. But the disadvantages are poor services from Bajaj and poor quality material.  "
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Awesome Bike,4,"Before two years i bought platina because i need a bike which gives 60 plus average. Today i'm very happy thay i choose platina. This bike is super cool. It has no need for frequent service. It never gave any problem in starting. It is Less in weight, so it is easy to handle on city roads. Engine does not give any problem even after very long drive. I drive 30-35 km daily. It runs smoothly. it is more comfortable than other bike of this segment. It has longer seat than other bikes. Bike price is also lower than other main bikes. As this bike has many features but this bike is not for the younger generation who prefer power over mileage.  It becomes almost impossible to control if u reach over 85 kmph and the max speed is only 98 kmph and it won't go above it. If anyone wanna use this bike for stunting just forget it. This bike is mainly for average not for show off. As this bike is light weight so it is difficult to ride on high areas. "
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Awesome bike for regular use,4,"I am a student and for going college I had a requirement of economical bike.my father bought bajaj platina for me in 2010.firstly I got upset because I need a sports bike but when I use platina for few days ,my experience with it was great.I have completed over 80000km with it and the great news is that bike is working fine till now .This bike only required engine oil change in every 1000-1200km and full servicing every 6 month that will cost around Rs.500-1000rs only. after first five service I have enjoyed up to 80 kmpl mileage on long run and in city 65-70 kmpl.bike having Less weight, so it is easy to handle on city roads. Engine does not give any problem even after very long drive.I drove continuously for 300km from ludhiana to Delhi.my bike is of old model but now the new model has many more feautres such as electric start,alloy wheels, new look which make this bike much more attractive. Overall this bike is worth for money."

Bajaj Platina 110,4,Perfect commuter,3,"Hello everyone…..My name is Vishal Mehta from Varanasi.  I am sharing my views regarding Bajaj Platina on this Auto Portals. My experiences with this bike is awesome. This is a real commuter with very cheap cost and kinder to your pocket. I bought this bike in 2012 when I was in college. The bike looks very simple and there is no cosmetic upgrades on this bike. The 100cc engine is the best part, it generates mileage of 85 kmpl but the power and pick up of is very less. In initial days, before 1st service, it was giving mileage around 90 kmpl. Engine does not vibrates and no sound there. The condition of my bike is very good because I maintained it well, I have done timely oil change and servicing.  The bike has very long and comfortable seats and the distance between handle and seats provides comfortable and pain free journey. The suspension are nice and enough to take all road bumps. The only disadvantage is bike feels too low when it rides by heavy persons. The gripping of tyres are good, even on wet roads. Overall the bike is nice. "
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Nice for me,3,"I’m a proud owner of bajaj patina 100 from last 3 years. I had ride this bike for almost 40, 000 kms, and it gives me best experience for every km. This bike is really good one especially for city drivers, it givse very good mileage and comfort that a rider demands.it has better pickup than hero honda 100cc bikes. My bike is giving me 65-70kmpl from last 3 years consistently. I had never faced engine problems in my bike uptil now.the engine sounds like a new bike now also. The best thing about this bike is, it is very comfortable for long drive .u will not feel tired during long drive.my bike’s milege on highways is really surprising about 75-80 kmpl. In addition to this, platina’s power is more than any other 100cc bike in the market(8.2 bhp).this figure is not only theoretical actually also u will feel good power while driving this bike. My friend shashi dadlani also have this bike, which is also giving good milege(70kmpl) and performance.he is driving his bike from last 4 years for almost 60, 000. One thing here i want 2 tell that, bajaj bikes demands little bit more care towards them than hero honda bikes, If u do proper servicing at proper time u will get best results . I’m not over telling about platina, this is my real experience with my bike. Don’t think that bajaj bikes r not durable or their engines r not good.its not true at all.bajaj is progressing rapidly and their bikes r also good. So i strongly recommends this bike for all who are planning to buy new 100cc bikes ."
Bajaj Platina 110,4,nothing like platina,5,I am riding this awesome bajaj product since last 5 years and i can assure you that this is a bike worth for money...i think no one can get more reliable bike them platina at any cost.Riding experiance is good and maintainance cost is just for saying only.I dont remember when the last time i had to invest on my bajaj motor parts..I have already rided it around 50000 km and still it gives me the same fearless ride like before.I am now a very loyal customer of bajaj and their products.Love is My Platina and awesome is riding it ..Recently one of my friend also purchased platina after my sugession and he is also very happy with platina..its milage is so cost efficient and one can easyly bear its ride.A totally rough use bike and i can assure u it will never fond u disappointing..Its look is pretty cool ..even if a college going boy is riding it then also it dont look any weird ..i ll give it a perfect 10 ..I suggest every one to give it a chance and enjoy riding this....happy riding :)
Bajaj Platina 110,4,awesome bike,5,"The company is giving new models and alterations to the body of many bikes like pulsar, discover. Why dont platina can be remodeled bring it on 150cc  give a good look to the bike surely it will be great in the market , bcoz platina is an good economical bike for an normal people. So they will also have some wish in the looks of platina. So kindly give platina a new look.but over all is good. Good mileage. Nice bike.No need for frequent service. Never gave any problem in starting. Less weight, so it is easy to handle on city roads. Average mileage in city of around 55 to 60 kmpl. Engine does not give any problem even after very long drive. I drove continuou own a Bajaj Platina, since 2 years and have received very good mileage from it. It gives me around 87 in city and 101 on highways. Only maintenance is a disadvantage. Also it does not look very stylish and is what i call best in class! Go for it if you are a mileage minded person, but if you are a rough driver then this bike is not for you !"
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Awesome Bike In Low Budget,4,"Bajaj Platina 100  as it is  100cc  bike so power is not that much  but it is a more than enough. Bike Comes with Alloy wheel and Mask  so looks is good. Bike length is better than any  bike in 100cc  segment  that mean comfort to seat. The best  part is, Bike giving a mileage over 80+ kmpl very handy to pocket  that means  you cut  monthly  expense. A good thing about platina Price is less  than 45k, so why not go for Platina  which gives comfort, mileage, and stylish look  in less  price. I’m using this bike since 19 oct 2006 and  I only change Oil regularly and change both the tyres once, do servicing in 5 month yet to point out a any flaws about this bike. Low maintenance bike. Back  looks is a bit pathetic but  side look is good  and weight of  bike is less but  its ok. Bajaj Platina 100 Kum me Bum bike for those who want to save money and want a reliable bike.i will suggest you buy Bajaj Platiina bike if you are looking for low budget bike. Thanks"
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Best Bike In Mileage.,5,"Bajaj Platina was of my first bike which I bought on last year. Main features of Platina is of it's high mileage with great fuel efficiency. Maintenance is also low. I have also travelled for long journey's also without any hesitations. It was a pleasurable ride ever on that time with my friend. Fuel was sufficient in amount during our rides because to it's fuel efficiency. Head, Tail and fog lamps were well designed. Overall look of bike is stylish in anyway with it's new graphics. Along with new alloy wheels too. Seating was comfortable too ride In village and narrow roads. I felt like I was riding a horse instead of bike due to it's smooth running experience. I went for many trips in my bike and felt a new experience ever to share. The thing is how you ride it and make it more easily in any circumstances. I am sure that whoever owns this bike will never regret of buying further on. Although you will get new experiences with loads of memorable moments with every ride with this bike. So enjoy your rides and share your experiences also like as me."

Bajaj is a renowned brand so if for service and parts you can found it easily anywhere in india.This bike has sporty look.My bike is 5 year old but still give a good mileage.I must prefer this bike if any one want a budget bike with a good mileage and easy maintenance.yet there are some things that you may not like as the weight of the bike is not so much that is around 110 kg.but if you have to use 10km less than per day than it would be a great bike.The bike has 99.27 cc engine.Max power is 8.2 Bhp at 7500 rpm. Fuel tank capacity is around 13.5 which is ok.Max torque is 8.05Nm at 4500  rpm. ground clearance is 165.00 mm.it has 4 stroke engine.so overall a good bike as mileage , cost of bike ,maintenace and service avaliablity all over india. And now the model also has feature of electric start"

Bajaj Platina 110,4,super bike,4,I worked in a bank and I have to travel 50
Bajaj Platina 110,4,designing is awesome,3,"I am a customer of Bajaj Platina 100CC and I am using it for more than 9 years, it is the best bike I had ever used because of its durability. The engine which is the DTSii engine makes it a very good bike with a high pick-up. It has got very stylish design which gives modern look to the bike. The bike has very good aerodynamic balance which helps to balance the bike very easily. The mileage of the bike is very high. It gives a mileage of 75-85 depending on how you drive. It is the best bike in its range as compared to Honda Twister, Hero Splender and many others. The Dual suspensions of the bike make the ride comfortable. The bike runs smoothly and much shocks are not felt even on poor roads. It is truly the value for money bike in its range and it is also the best starter bike for a new rider"
Bajaj Platina 110,4,must buy this bike,5,"i use bike since 6 years bike is awesone for mileage .its  smoothnesh is very wonder full  bike like like cyclce type weight. i always advise to buy bajaj bike because its service,company promotion,mileage,engine ,parts is very good than other brand ..its workshop avaibal in alll india i  Its design is just fab.Also the average is pretty high.The seat is pretty comfortable.It can be easily handled and controlled."
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Bajaj is Bajaj ,5,"I am bike addicted.  I used many brands bike but still love my fathers bajaj.  The milage of Bajaj is too good.  I used to asked father to change the bike, this is too old fashion bike.  But riding once I it's too comfortable bike. The bike is light weight. It's speed is quite slow.  In short I can say it's truly Indian bike. This bike takes less space for parking. Even in rainy day I used my it's face no problem. In loading also this bike runs smoothly.  I always prefer people to purchase this if you want good bike at low budget.  In future if I  purchase any  bike I would buy from bajaj.  Bajaj is well known for finance also.  You can finance your bike from bajaj finance and pay money in instalment.  Bajaj is easy to use.  Warranty service are also good.  In short it's totally family bike for every one.  Bike has three person capacity. I saw many bike heat easily eve aftern running 1 km but bajaj had no problems like that. In last I would say bajaj is Bajaj. "
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Bajaj Platina The Cheapest Bike.,3,"I had brought this bike in the year 2008, because i did not have that much capital at time time so in 40k the only bike available is bajaj platina. The bike has 100cc engine, alloy wheels, analogue speedometer, kick start. As all know this mileage mention is of 100kmpl which is true, which make it cost worthy in this period of increasing petrol prices, The major drawback i got in this bike is it is very light weight because of which it becomes impossible for the bike to gain speed, yes it has good mileage but poor speed also, After three to two years its engine starts making sound which indirectly means that you have to start saving some money for the bike every year. So although it is the cheapest bike but the quality is also very cheap. Now a days lot more other bikes are available in the market at same price, So i suggest you to got to some other option in 40k bikes or add some more money and buy a good one, because its better to invest money at once instead of investing every year"
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Good ,3,Bajaj platina is a good bike with some advance features.
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Bajaj Platina Review,4,Bike is very good for daily commuting. Best fuel efficient bike in this category. If one wants fuel efficiency surely go for this bike. Top speed is 95 kmph. Bike easily reaches 70kmph on highway. Better than Honda in fuel efficiency.

Bajaj Platina 110,4,milage king.,5,"I bought this Bajaj Platina 100 KS alloy bike  5 year before. it's performence is superb. it is fuel efficient because it gives mileage over 70 Km per liter. it is neccessary to tell you that for security resion you must wear your helmate while riding your bike. I must wear  helmate while riding my bike.  when i will bought a new bike I will prefer for Bajaj bike. a disappointment  for me  that this bike is with out electric start. i will say that for you, when you want to buy a new bike, first you ride an bajaj bike of you friend circle. you will see the result. bajaj bikes are cheap compair to other bike company.  when you buy an bajaj bike, you will have not to pay any charge for next 4-5 year for mentenance. if you care your bike then this time period  will be more than this.  after sale service is quite goot or you can say that after sale service is brillient. mentenance cost after the purchase your bike is very low compair to any other bike company. i will say that think about it before you purchase your bike. i have a great experiance with bajaj bikes."

Bajaj Platina 110,4,Awsome bike,4,"i like new platina 100es because these have lots of new features,"
Bajaj Platina 110,4,GOOD BIKE BEST MILLEAGE,5,
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Nice bike with Superb milage.,4,"My experience is that this is good if you are 1. maintaining it well (dont go on low maintainece cost as suggested by many like 1800 in four years). Timely oil change and servicing will do good. 2. In one hand - you share it with many guys and the result will be not far. I required engine work at 38000 km only, because I handed the keys to many guys over this period.   No doubt with guys on this forum who rode 60-70000 kms and happy because this is really good. Fuel wise very economical. In initial days, before 1st service, it was giving mileage around 90 kmpl. But very soon it comes around 60. after 2 servicing I say. I spent a lot of time, I remember, in bajaj service centre, arguing, why it cant give a mileage now what it was before, but to no avail. If you are lucky and maintaining it in true way, may be you can get 70 also.  :-( Disadvantage:- very light weight, I remember times, when I turned more than 90 degree when I applied sudden brakes. Over all its a very cool bike.."
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Bajaj Platina 100 ES review,3,"As the name suggests, the new variant gets an electric starter which was badly missed in the erstwhile model. The Platina ES is long and sleek in the flesh, with a refreshed front fascia that it largely carries forward from the regular Platina. But overall, the ES is almost completely redesigned."
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Mileage king,5,"While I’ve never been a fan of motorcycles that sip rather than burn away their fuel, I have to admit that I’m quite intrigued with the Bajaj Platina 100 ES. Bajaj claim that this little 100cc motor will sip on one litre of fuel for the better part of 97 kilometres, inching ever so close to the 100kmpl mark. Since most motorcycles give a higher figure on the highway mileage run, we might actually cross that magic mark – this test should be fun."

Bajaj Platina 110,4,Awesome Bike for regular use ,4,Platina is a awesome bike for regular use. Since I have been using this bike from 5 years it gives superb mileage of approx 70-75 kmpl. Maintenance of this bike is also very less than the other bikes of this class. It is very comfortable bike for long ride due its body design. The bike has a better grip on road while turnings and twists as it comes with alloy rims and big ted blocks which gives it a better grip in the season of rain and monsoon. the bike has good speed approx 100-110 kmph. The pick-up of the bike is also very good. Bike reaches 0-60 in a very lesser time comparatively to other. The graphics and look of bike is very good. As platina comes with 100cc engine but the engine of this bike is very powerful. I can easily load approx 3 quintal of weight with no problem. The tail light and head light of bike is very good in design and flashy in night. I would like to recommend this bike to those who want a better bike in lesser price for daily and routine purpose.                 
Bajaj Platina 110,4,A perfect bike,4,"suspension of the Platina is absolutely impressive. seat is pretty comfortable even on a prolonged ride and long enough to seat two comfortably.the bike comfortably cruises at 50-60 km/hr, though overtaking does need some planning. The vibrations from the engine are well contained.the Platina ES is well priced and with the high fuel efficiency, is a good value for money product too."
Bajaj Platina 110,4,average bike with excellent milage,3,Style Old in style and slightly long seat for pillion riders not works great.
Bajaj Platina 110,4,nice bike,3,this is the first bike that I had took a ride or I can say that this it first bike from which I have learnt riding bike. this bike is very nice for fresher's who are new to ride bike as it is light weight as compared to other bike

Bajaj Platina 110,4,A super bike i owned,4,"While I’ve never been a fan of motorcycles that sip rather than burn away their fuel, I have to admit that I’m quite intrigued with the Bajaj Platina 100 ES. Bajaj claim that this little 100cc motor will sip on one litre of fuel for the better part of 97 kilometres, inching ever so close to the 100kmpl mark. Since most motorcycles give a higher figure on the highway mileage run, we might actually cross that magic mark – this test should be fun"
Bajaj Platina 110,4,very bad spare parts assemble in this bike,1,This is very very bad bike...
Bajaj Platina 110,4,impressive ,4,"it's been 5 years now since i bought bajaj platina it had no problem at all. I like its looks and it's comfort. Because of my profession I've to travel a lot and in long distance journey it felt very comfortable. i use to put a lot of weight on it but still it stays as comfortable as it was. Because of its unique design it always stays comfortable and in speed. i am really a tough rider i took it out in rainy seasons where in delhi we have a lot of holes on roads and blockage causes the road to get totally drowned in water but even on that stage where cars can't move, i easily ride out. engine is as powerful as (not as hulk though) required. The best part is mileage(what we Indians really cares about) you should know it gives 87.87 KMPL. enough to take you very far from others. customer support is very good and bajaj is an Indian company. and budget yes ! i am damn sure that it will definitely fits in your budget because it's just 43,241( price for nov 2015) in ex showroom. so i highly recommend you to buy this and feel the amazing comfort and style. "
Bajaj Platina 110,4,Simple sober and best indian commuter,4,"Bajaj platina was my first bike. The only bike in its segment with good looks, features, less price & most importantly mileage. The first thing any middle class person will prefer is high mileage from his bike in college days. I used this bike around two and a half year then i gave it to my uncle so now he uses for his daily commute. To be honest i am around 6 feet tall and platina doesn't suit me so i switched to pulsar 220. So if you are a tall guy i recommend you not to invest in this bike. But if you are looking for mileage its the perfect bike for you. When i was using the bike it used to return me about 85kmpl which is now degraded to around 82-83kmpl after so much of use which is not bad. If we talk about the looks, its quite simple but way better than the other brands. The bike is sleek and can cut through traffic easily. Power is the only thing you would feel less because of its 100cc engine which churns around 8 bhp i guess but still the performance is good. I didn't liked the seat as it was bite uncomfortable to ride on a hard seat for long rides. But as the seating position is straight up right you wont feel any pain in one hour of riding. If maintained and services properly this bike will serve you the best it can give. Spare parts of this bike are easily available anywhere and also in cheap price. In case of servicing bajaj service centres are very poor. One thing i noticed is that the fitting of the headlamps is bit loose. If not covered in rainy season water enters inside the headlamp. Not yet sure from where does the water accumulates inside it. I will suggest bajaj to look after this issue."

Finally, the brand understood that the only way to increase sales was to make the necessary major adjustments to this power cruiser. That is the focus of the 2019 Dominar 400. large improvements for large tourers!"

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Love at first sight.. ,4,"One fine day i had an urge to get a bike. I started doing my research and was getting somewhere with the likes of karizma 220, tvs apache 180 but then i laid my eyes on this. Oh man oh man! i fell in love at first sight. Of-course the design was a bit way too much for me. But guess what, i was in college at that time whatever thing had to offer i wanted it. I was also given the option of the rc 200. For what it's worth, i was very much deviating towards the rc only. However the low mileage and the lack of abs is what made me change my mind. The dealership in the whole Mumbai didn't have the black colour but i was hell bent on getting the black one only. So i ended up buying it from Executive bajaj. The whole process was super smooth. The chaps there were extremely helpful and straightforward. I paid in cash so can't say much about how the financing system really worked.So far it's been more than 2 years that i've had this baby and it's been a sweet right. For my riding style, it has enough oomph. I'm satisfied. The red line is usually around 10.5k and the low end performance is not that great. So yeah the acceleration is not that thrilling as compared to maybe.. An rc 200. At the same time, the mid and top end really shine on this thing. Oh how eager this engine is at those levels. Plus the handling is also neat thanks to the zappers which came pre-installed. Also, the riding position is definitely not aggressive at all, rather, just the right amount. So it doesn't kill your back on long rides. The front leds over the projector lamps look good where as the main headlights provide superb illumination at night. The abs works as expected and has literally saved my life a few time. Here's a good thing to note people, don't compromise on abs.. If you can get it, get it. It'll change your life. The shockers at front are alright but sometimes a but too soft whereas the monoshock on the back is decent. These shocks seem to be tuned for indian roads and potholes :) the engine is liquid cooled so. The radiator does a good job in keeping it cool, i have not run out of coolant yet. The looks obviously are a bit to aggressive. On top of that some people laminate the front visor and remove the rear view mirrors to give it a proper indian squid vibe. My advise, don't do that, it's ugly. Follow safety norms and don't stunt on main roads.Pros:1.) the best value for money for the current indian segment2.) sports breed but doesn't kill your back3.) the pillion seat is better than that of the rc and other bikes in this segment 4.) comes with abs. Even though its single channel only, it's there! 5.) low maintenance as compared to other bikes in this segment. Cons:1.) the damn hud. Man this thing has driven me crazy. Sometimes it turns on sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it restarts in the middle of me riding, resets my trips and the clock and sometimes it works fine. 2.) the pillion seat is after all not that amazing. There's nothing to hold onto other than the unrealistic grab rails which are withing the bike frame only. If you've got a girl on your back, she'll be in a better position than being on an rc ofcourse, but she'll hate the whole ride, her back with start to pain, unless of-course she leans on you and sit properly like it's intended to. Well.. 3.) a bit too heavy. Weighs around 165 kgs."

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Mind blowing Performance,5,"The Bajaj Pulsar RS 200 ABS is a mind blowing and fabulous performance bike. Anyway, before I hit the track on the RS200, I was given a crisp download of the product. The bike has undergone some major, and some not-so-major revisions compared to the Pulsar 200NS - the product which the RS200 is chiefly based on. However, all that chatter needs to translate into actual performance advantage - with the RS200, it does."

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,  my First ride ,4,"Before I start off with my impression of the Bajaj Pulsar RS200 after the brief ride I had on it at Bajaj's test track in Chakan, I must accept that I suffer from a little paranoia and reluctance when it comes to the Pulsar name. I've had a love-hate relationship with the Bajaj Pulsar. I've ridden all the Pulsars to come out till now, and have had some really good moments with them. I also suffered a very severe accident a decade-and-a-half ago while riding the original Pulsar 180 that almost cost me my life. That's stuck with me ever since."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,"BAJAJ PULSAR RS200 full review DESIGN,ENGINE",4,"DESIGN:- The Pulsar RS 200's sportsbike looks are contemporary, but really busy and flashy, making this a bike that is not going to appeal to conservative buyers. A wide, see through visor sits in front offering a clear view ahead at night. The twin headlights do a brilliant job of lighting the road ahead, just as on previous Pulsars."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,RS 200,5,Vry gud bike and vry good service provide by the bajaj company...
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,A GOOD BIKE IN LOOKS AND VALUE FOR MONEY,4,"Bikes look good and sexy in shape.Black color looks sexy..Wider shape means that it feels bulkier and more muscular. Its thicker handlebar grips have an enhanced texture and reinforce the feel of control, despite it being a large bike. Riding the bike is simple and enjoyable: the overall seating position is predominantly upright, ideal for moving through city traffic, and the seat has been positioned higher in conjunction with a shortened wheelbase, lending it greater agility. The fuel tank has a capacity of 12 litres. When moving through traffic it feels smooth and refined.The next on my agenda is to go to Ladakh on my bike with my bro-in-law on his Avenger (I bet he will imitate the Feel like god commercial once he reaches there  )."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Good looking and Excellent Bike of the Year,5,"Guys i just wanted to share our experience here, Style is awesome. Tail lamp is very good looking although some may hate it. It makes evry1 turn der heads towards it. that's for sure."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4,"The RS200 is not as entertaining as the R15 or the RC200 - those bikes are in proper full-attack mode from the word go, whereas with the RS, you need to spend more and more time on it to get familiar with its boundaries and character. Its limits are not as great as its rivals from KTM and Yamaha, but at being a flaunt machine, the RS200 might just be good enough for some unusual college-goers.The tail-lamps, too, are just a bit too weird, and the rear section from the front seat on, leading up to the lights reminds me a bit of the Karizma and the original Xtreme by Hero. Strange, I know. The RS200 looks a bit over-the-top, a bit too try-hard, a bit silly, a bit brash, and a bit fussy. It gives a sense that Bajaj designers were deliberately thinking hard to make the RS200 stand out. It may have worked in a way though - the RS does catch the eye easily, but not in the most pleasing ways. Overall It is a Good bike and worth my money. :D "
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,bike is best at its price range,5,The Bajaj Pulsar RS200 impressed us on the race track
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,good milleage with superb pickup ,4,"I have purchase this bike on aug and from my experienced till now its  a very good bike as compare to other bike which comes  in same range and pickup is also very good  and the milleage is also near about 50 which is also good and the main thing which is like is its sports look and the technology which is used in it is also very superb  and its also has a powerful sport engine and the backseat is also very good for couples and it also have a powerful breaking system    and bajaj also have a vast service network  and it's service center people in indore is also very good  and  it also have Twin projector headlamps, crystal LED tail light, aggressive muscular styling, nitrox mono suspension, perimeter frame, triple-spark 4-valve DTSi engine, fuel injection system, race exhaust and  it crosses 0-100 speed in 10 seconds  and Like other Pulsar bikes, the RS200 also comes equipped with an analog-digital instrument console.

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Dream Bike Pulsar,3,I have Bajaj pulsar RS 200  and it is very good. It has 10 liter fuel tank  capacity moreover it gives approx 40 km/liter on highway and 30 km/liter in city.
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Best Bike,5,"I bought this bike in the evening of 4 July. And from that day I rode it 384 kms, there is nothing which is lacking in performance or in any other things. The bike is very excellent in performance, I took it to 149 kmph and it catches the speed very easily. There is no sign of vibration above 135 kmph , thanks to its pressed perimeter frame to handle the engine at high revs. The bike is awesome at high speed and very very very much stable at corners and road due to its weight. Which is very good for race lovers. This gives the mileage of around 34-35 kmpl. Which increased to 38-40kmpl after first service. So no concerns for so much refilling of tank. And in the last the looks of the bike is awesome from the purchase date more than 100 people asked me about the bike. The overall performance of the bike is awesome. Even 220 is unmatched in performance with bike. So the other bikes likes KARIZMA ZMR, R15, APACHE, CBR150R have to stand in the footpath, when it comes on the road. Who is planning to buy it , I personally suggest him buy today and feel the soul of bike."

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,a powerful bike with good milleage,4,"I have purchased pulsar 200 RS in Aug The most advanced Pulsar yet, the new Bajaj Pulsar 200 RS is nothing less than a super-bike in terms of design. The complicated looking front of RS200 houses projector lamps for increased visibility and style with an addition of LED eyebrows, which boosts its aggressiveness to a new level. Small yet attractive exhaust adds to its racing appeal. Body cuts and curves are marvellous and they definitely will leave all of your side thoughts behind. "

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,"Styling, performance ",5,"The Pulsar RS200 is a feisty full-fairing offering from Bajaj, which packs in the great price-performance in its class . It is also fast, no doubt. But, its true highlight is it's easy to ride nature.The moment you start the bike, you’ll be welcomed by a familiar engine noise. Yes- it sounds like a combination of the KTM’s roar and the NS’s purr. The revv-happy engine builds the revs quickly yet smoothly, and there is plenty of power available on the tap (24.5 HP at 9750 Rpm, thanks to the Bosch EFI system) when you rev it >8000 Rpm. The engine can Pull from as low as 25 Km/h in 5th, thanks to the DTS-i head. The Bike is pretty nimble and can be used for daily commutes and for those occasional long weekend Highway rides as well. It comes with MRF tubeless radial tires, which are medium compound ones. The tires gripped well, great for an OEM provided set. Braking duties are handled by the Bulbous 300 mm single disc in the front and a 230mm disc at the rear. They’re Bybre calipers, with the brakes having good feedback. They get steel braided lines as standard, which is a welcome addition. I got to ride the Non-ABS variant and thus, can’t comment on the ABS’ function and quality."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Excellent Performance And Dashing Look,5,Pulsar 200 RS is a great bike with beautiful design and economical price.The front and rear seats are both comfortable.The headlight is really good that enables bikers to ride smoothly even when the visibility is very low to few meters.The tyres are tubeless and are of finest quality with good wheels.But what I feel disappointed with the tyres are its size.I feel if the size of the tyres would have been larger it would have been even great.The roadgrip is really good.The engine is similar to that of pulsar 200 NS except the fuel injection system which is slightly modified.The power rating is good with horse power of 24 bhp and peaks out at 9750 rpm.
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Not Good Bike For Money,3,Style is Excellent. Tail lamp is very good looking although some may hate it. because of old model style and design and price

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,PULSAR RS 200 ,4,"I was very excited when I got my  Bajaj Pulsar RS200,  It was the most anticipated motorcycle from Bajaj because it was going to open the doors of the budget fully-faired entry-level performance motorcycles. With India’s ever growing young population, the Pulsar RS200 seems to have attracted lot of interest. Pulsar RS200 is the prettiest motorcycle with the Bajaj badge. The overall design language is fresh and aggressive. Some design inspiration is visible from the Japanese but the Indian industrial designers have done a good job. But while I appreciate their effort, I find the motorcycle’s design a bit too busy. The front fascia reminds me of the Bumblebee from the famous Transformers property. Look very closely and the placements of the two projector headlamps will remind you of the rattlesnake – very aggressive, and with a character of its own.  It gets two LED pilot lamps, which are flanked by small decals to make the design lively. The turn indicators are the ones seen on the KTM Duke 200. The windscreen is big and quite useful during rides."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,a awasome bike,5,"While comparing with other 200CC bikes,Bajaj Pulsar stands ahead.I have been Using this bike this for last 6 years and never faced any issue.Awesome and unique style inspired me alot.The RS200 comes powered by a 4-valve, triple spark, DTSi engine with fuel injection and liquid cooling. The engine delivers 24.5Ps of power and 18.6Nm of torques. Bajaj says that the RS200 redlines at 11000rpm and top speed is rated at 141km/h.I bought this bike after reading so many reviews on different sites and most of the reviews were positive which forced me to buy this and After using it continuously i can say that it was a wise decision to buy Bajaj Pulsar.I would love to give it 5 Stars In my point of view it is the best piece of Bajaj which has every feature.. have already recommended it to most of my friends.So if you are looking for a stylish bike with high average and affordable price then go for it."

It is beautifully designed and the pickup is quite impressive. The large front of bike encases the entire engine. The front lights are LED with beautiful projectors looking good. It has tubeless tyres which is quite helpful at the time of puncture. I mean to say in that condition you can also run even bike is punctured. It has double disc brakes and alloy wheels which provides the motorcycle more stability. It gives me awesome riding experience because of the riding position is quite sporty. Brakes are powerful and more so with the rear brake.the bike is awesome at high speed and very very very much stable at corners and road due to its weight. Which is very good for race lovers. The first drawback of this bike is that it is very heavy  in weight and another is that it has only 13 litres of fuel tank which is not so good. It gives me a mileage of 30 to 35 kmpl which is not satisfied"
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,The Bajaj Pulsar RS 200 ABS,5,"The Bajaj Pulsar RS 200 ABS is a mind blowing and fabulous performance bike. Anyway, before I hit the track on the RS200, I was given a crisp download of the product. The bike has undergone some major, and some not-so-major revisions compared to the Pulsar 200NS - the product which the RS200 is chiefly based on. However, all that chatter needs to translate into actual performance advantage - with the RS200, it does."

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Bajaj Pulsar RS200 - Ownership review,4,"One of the best value for money bike in the segment in spec wise as well as on the practical side. The engine is peppy and meets all your expectations as an entry level sports bike. It is also good for daily commuting and for weekend touring. Comfort in riding is due to good upright seating posture makes no back pain or wrist pain. Onroad presence is also the best similar to 300+ CC bikes in the market. When compared to Yamaha R15 V3 which is a feature-rich bike and KTM RC200 the track bike both are also better options but not ideal for touring due to aggressive seating posture. If you are on a budget of under 2 lacs, Bajaj Pulsar RS200 is the best option to choose whether to tour or for daily commuting with a good mileage of around 35 KMPL. Cons - fairing vibration after 7000 RPM and lack of slipper clutch. Due to these reasons, I gave it a 4-star rating. Overall, it is a VFM offering from Bajaj India."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,The best of all time,5,The bike is perfect for the youth. Bajaj has given all young and fresh elements in this bike as it always does. The bike keeps the competition levels higher.
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,3,"I bought dual-tone black RS 200 abs at last month and the on-road price of this bike is 1,69,000 Hyderabad  This bike with good features and mainly daylights look and pickup was super and sporty and overall its look like a premium bike. The exhaust is awesome sound droom droom . I like that so much and one thing I disappointed about dust regularly we have to clean it and. it was so delicate bike but strong body if you want to maintain it well then you have to do regular service if you get any vibration and etc just give the bike to service centre don't give it outside mechanic. And one more thing about the bike it has more chances to start without a key so keep it in the security area and it has good safety features like stand alert. Accident alert and direct fuel injection. And mileage about this bike it was giving me 35kmph. I drive this bike at 60 to 70 speed if Your budget is 2lakhs just close your eyes and bye it. "

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Nice and excellent bike.,5,Looking wise this bike is great and pickup and mileage are too good. Very smooth if I go to high speed.
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Best in the segment.,5,This bike has enough power in 200 segments. If you ignore some vibration from instrument console than there is no other disadvantage of this bike. Stable at high speed and braking system with ABS RS200 is value for money. 
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Sporty and killer looks,5,"I had always wanted to purchase a more sporty and well-built motorcycle for myself, and when I decided to purchase at price of  200 for about two lacs, my wish came true. The six-speed gear mechanism makes for a very enjoyable driving experience. Additionally, it feels so very light that I am at a loss for words. Very pleasant and smooth ride."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Good looking bike.,5,Best price for a 200cc model for a branded bike.
Bajaj Pulsar NS 125,4.2,Pulsar NS 125 Is Comfortable For The Rider,4,"My interest was drawn in by the Bajaj Pulsar NS 125's remarkable features and appearance. Although the rider's seat is rather comfortable, I must admit that the pillion seat may occasionally be a little uncomfortable. Longer journeys may not be as pleasurable for the pillion rider since the seat may not offer the same amount of support and cushioning. However, the Pulsar NS 125 still provides a comfortable ride for the user, even if they typically travel alone or with a few pillion passengers. Overall, it is a good bike only they can work a little on the seat. "
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Best sports bike,4,"One can write a lot about RS 200 due to being so attractive but I will say two things, it is one of the best sports bikes in the segment as it has a good 199.5cc of the engine and which is lightweight with six-speed transmission. Also, it gives good enough mileage as well."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Beast in looks,4,"Before launching, this model company named it as SS model but later changed it to RS. It became one of the hottest-looking bikes in the segment. The front side looks like a beast in red and white color plus it is in an effective price range. "
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Very attractive and reasonable,4,"The bike is very easy to manage and exhibits its original power while accelerating beyond 6000 revolutions per minute. The bike requires little money to maintain. In comparison to all faired motorcycles, the seat position is also generally pleasant. I've driven about 5000 kilometers on it and have taken several trips on it. It has a fantastic fuel economy of 35 to 37 kilometers per liter, making it the greatest 200cc sports bike."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Pickup works well,3,"Those seats are awful. For short trips only, use this bike. Back and shoulder soreness will result from using this for lengthy rides. Ergonomic design is not present in this bicycle. The ground clearance on this bike is really low. Silence on every breaker"
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Highly Improved Vehicle,4,"The Pulsar RS200's peak speed is 151 kmph, according to Bajaj, although I was able to reach 144 kmph on the straightaway at the test track. The bike's overall weight has increased by a whopping 20kg as a result of the added fairing and the ABS unit. Despite being so heavy, the RS200 performed admirably on the highway."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,The most attractive - Pulsar RS200,4,"The general design aesthetic is modern and assertive. Although the Japanese are a source of some design inspiration, Indian industrial designers did an excellent job. But even while I value their effort, I believe the motorcycle's look is a little overdone."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Bajaj could have done better - Pulsar RS 200,5,"The front fascia of RS 200 is dashing, and it has the capabilities to charm anyone. But looks are not everything the ride quality is a bit poor and stiff. I think Baja could do better with it. The switching from first gear to second gear is rigged and feels like one requires effort to do that. "
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Best Naked Sports Bike In The Segment,4,"If you are looking for a naked sports bike with good mileage then this must be a great choice for you. Also, the ride quality is way more comfortable. And it comes from a great trustworthy brand Bajaj.   "

Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,It is simple to live with,4,"The Bajaj Pulsar NS160 should be your choice if you're looking for a high-end commuter with aggressive styling, a respectably strong engine, amazing features, and simple handling. Additionally, Bajaj's extensive service network and reasonably priced replacement parts make "
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Best bike pulsar ns200,5,"This bike is value for money and has the best mileage. The Bajaj Pulsar is an iconic Indian motorcycle. Since its inception, the Pulsar created a new segment called ‘Sports Biking’ in Indian motorcycling and redefined motorcycle riding for the Indian youth. The cutting-edge Bajaj Pulsar specifications are 125-250 cc engines, front and rear disc brakes, nitrox-mono-shock suspension, and tubeless tyres. "
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Premium bike,4,It is a premium bike with a powerful engine of 160.3cc capacity which is a fast and furious daily commuter bike. It has some stylish ends and edges over the fuel tank but old fashioned instrument cluster which kills the show of the bike. It is a lightweight bike giving head-on competition to its rivals.

The only problem occur in this is only disc breaking problem. The mileage of my bike is about 45Km/l. Its graphics and sport wheel are superbbb. No any disturbance on speed greater than 135km/h. It has wonderful pickup and regarding as fast and best bike as compared to any other bike. You can smoke anyone with this mind blowing speed. But bajaj have to improve this bike technically because he can much better as we aspect. I suggest all my friends to buy bajaj pulsar 220 because of its enormous speed and comfortable handling.
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,most amazing bike i owned till now,5,Pulsar 220 F..the most amazing bike i bought till now. Its best in everything whether look wise or by performance.

Bike is comfortable for long routes also. Stylish bike. Person riding this bike has a different personality. I prefer pulsar better than duke. Its engine gives good performance of riding. I haven't faced a single problem yet from this bike. Also my family bought it as it is not costly compared to its feautures. And the best thing is that anyone can ride this whether young or old. Everyone looks perfect om this. Among all bikes of bajaj pulsar is best. Even every pulsar model is superb. I just wanna thank bajaj for this awesome bike. M a rider now.

Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,pulsar 220 f ,4,I used it only 1 year 
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Excellent Bike for Everyday Use,5,"When I planned to purchase a new bike, I shortlisted some best bikes available in the market. 1. Apache RTR 160 (Double Disk) 2. Pulsar DTS-i 150 3. Trigger 150 (Double Disk) 4. FZS V2.0. These all bikes are best in their class. I want to purchase a bike which should be good in city mileage, with great comfort and in a medium price range. After a long research I found that Pulsar is the only bike which can provide me these features in a good price range. So let's look about the features of Pulsar 150 DTS-i. Pros: 1. MILEAGE - When we plan to purchase a new bike our first priority is its mileage. There is no doubt about the Pulsar's mileage that, it provide 50 KMPL in city. 2. COMFORT - The sitting position of this bike too good and its suspension is also good as it work good on bad roads and off road. 3. HANDLING - Bajaj has improved the handling in this bike which make this bike in great control in market ride and good stability on high speed. 4. ENGINE- The new pulsar has a improved engine than the old one. The sound feels good. RATING:- Design and Style- 8/10 Instrument Console- 8.5/10 Engine & Performance- 8.5/10 Comfort while Riding- 9/10 Mileage- 9/10 Brakes and Suspension- 9/10 Ride and handling- 9/10 Price- 8/10"
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Best Bike In Best Price,5,"comparing with other 200CC bikes,Bajaj Pulsar stands ahead.I have been Using this bike this for last 6 years and never faced any issue.Awesome and unique style inspired me alot.The RS200 comes powered by a 4-valve, triple spark, DTSi engine with fuel injection and liquid cooling. The engine delivers 24.5Ps of power and 18.6Nm of torques. Bajaj says that the RS200 redlines at 11000rpm and top speed is rated at 141km/h.I bought this bike after reading so many reviews on different sites and most of the reviews were positive which forced me to buy this and After using it continuously i can say that it was a wise decision to buy Bajaj Pulsar.I would love to give it 5 Stars In my point of view it is the best piece of Bajaj which has every feature.. have already recommended it to most of my friends.So if you are looking for a stylish bike with high average . take care use always hemetsIts just awesome..Had plenty of trips in this bike.I personally feel very happy.Missed few accidents because of good brakes especially the rear brakes works beautifully. its a bit heavy n certain times I don get confidence at wet terrains during cornering... rest all is fine... I have used few bikes earlier... but this bike stays on top of list in terms of performance n power delivery.. I had gone up to 148 km/hr with pillion ... I think it can do a bit more at least adding 2km/hr to make it into 150 series....its worth the money u pay... definitely duke 200 is much better than mine.. n coming to the mileage ... mine gives 37+ in cities and 40+ in highways.. it obviously depends on the rider... so overall its a good bike... pillion seating s not much comfortable in terms of cruising... so finally if there s no pain there is no gain.overall the bike performs the bst good mileage good power aesome look that everybody should "
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,dissapointed,4,"I bought a new Bajaj Pulsar 220 in 2012 as my previous pulsar which made me a very happy man was stolen.  My earlier bike gave me steady milage of 55kmpl and was low on maintanance. But my new pulsar 220 has a milage of 37-40 max. Have changed brake liner twice, cables a couple of times, battery once and that too in the 1st year itself. I am very disappointed with the performance,  milage and high maintenance cost. Have promised myself NEVER will I buy a bajaj product again. Be wise - think twice. "
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,bajaj avenger,4,I took bajaj avenger on rent when I went to goa in january 2015. I have travelled entire north goa and south goa with this bike and let me tell you it was too comfortable for me to ride for a long stretch. People having back problems and still want to ride should prefer this bike. Also the fuel consumption of the bike is low.The handling and control is quite good. The look of the bike is also pretty awesome.
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Excellent,5,

Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,A Great Combiation Of Power & Beauty,4,"There is absolutely no doubt about the style. Preferably I liked it.Some may not like it. Everyone has their own likings. So no objection for style.Engine performance is awesome.I came to know that 200ns's engine performance in good compared to 220. I dont no as I haven't ridden it yet. But 220 has a great power. Mine is new one, purchased on 27th February 2014. It's pickup is super. Its super smooth engine makes you happy while riding it. Its power can pull the bike fastly in busy traffic. Fuel economy, they say(company) it gives 40 +, but I don't think so, its above 35 but not above 40. I haven't checked my bikes economy as it new. Gearbox is not smooth(mine one), even after first service its hard. Handling is good. As its a big bike, turning radius is large but not as large as avenger, one can manage. When the bike is at still position you cant pull back or move forward. Its very heavy(for me,as I felt).I dint gave deep review about the bike as I'm not a biker nor expert rider. Actually I went to book 200ns. But it didn't suit for my height, so obviously 220f came to my hand. Im satisfied with the bike , but not fully.  Now it has become old . A little bit change in the design, performance, and also displacement could make that bike to reach to the sky. As I said it has become old, it doesn't mean that its not a good bike, if it was so I wouldn't have purchased it now. As 200ns is technically improved, I would like to suggest that bike too."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,beast in the range,5,"I bought my bike 1month back from a local dealer for 1lac aprx and from the day I am happy with the power that it delivers.after first servicing it delivers mileage of 45kmpl aprx. 0-60kmpl in aprx 4sec. Speed, milege,comfort,safet, its a combo of everything. I am too much happy with my decision for buying pulsar 220."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Great Experience,4,"Bajaj is the best company we have ever seen in manufacturing Automobiles.That too in pulsar is awesome.220F!! that is cool and one can get pickup in a faster way than any other bikes.Firstly, when ignition turns on there is a feeling like that you are going on a plane and not on a road.That feeling one cannot experience when we use other bikes.Secondly,after turning the smoke released is very light and it is very good to use these eco-friendly one's.The indicator's are working good and the lights are working in a excellent way .The design is very flexible and convenient to understand the intricacies involved in the design of the automobile.Mileage gives us more confidence in this super or god-made bike. We are feeling very friendly in using these bike for very long distances.Other person also feels comfortable even though they are not riding.This confidence must be present in everyone even"
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Great Looks and Superior Ride,4,"Hello everyone, this is Himanshu, I own pulsar 220 F since 2 years and to say honestly everytime I ride the bike it feels as if its brand new!"
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Bajaj is awesome,5,"Bajaj pulsar  is a super bike. The Bajaj 220F(DTS-i) which was launched in 2009 with a killer price tag, mainly aimed at increasing sales and bringing the performance biking within reach to the common man. But the steps taken by Bajaj was a unique one, they stepped back in terms of technology, they gave the 220 a carburetor instead of the existing Fuel-injection. But with this change they were able to reduce cost, increase power (21PS),torque and mileage , which made it a instant success within the masses. The aggressive pricing being the main attraction among the youth and growing breed of Serious Performance biking community of India. Now I got my Bike on March 2010. The parts that attracted me the most, the looks(I was a sucker for the twin projector headlights, the LED console), the touring friendly ergonomics, the power and torque and then the killer price tag. All in all it was the perfect vehicle, Complete Value for Money product and it was still a rare machine in my locality, all the more reason to opt for this bike."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Super Bike 220,4,"Salute to bajaj , being an Indian manufacturer they are doing so good in Automobiles. I hope one day they will make bikes even better than others .Awesome bike...... made by a India for India and I love hows about it being an entry level of  motorcycle. Sure it's sporty, and good looking. Service at Service center is poor! but bike so super really like it much and bajaj pulsar is my heart .pulsar  king of the bikes. very good bike in the world.Which world do you live in? Fuel is not produced in factories. Its supply is limited and finite. Recklessly spending it is not a bragging point anymore. Lower the cc of engine, higher the fuel efficiency and greater the ""greenness"" of the bike.Yes we'd all like to get a real bike but in the third world a 220 is big time.  anything above that is only for the super rich or drug dealers. I live in india and a 220 Pulsar is a hot bike for here.  because these people don't make the kinda money to ever in their wildest dreams afford to buy a ""real bike"" as you say.  so you have to understand the target market of these cheap bikes from india.  they're not for the 1st world.Naye Bharat Ki Nayi Raftar - this statement alone speaks everything -1.The New Bike 2.The New Version of Pulsar, 3.The Evolution of Bajaj and above all 4.The Emerging Super-power - INDIA."

Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Get Set Go!!,5,"I really enjoy driving my PULSAR 220f. Even after two years of regular riding of my bike, my love for my bike is still fresh. Still I look for excuses to take my beast out in open. With such a smooth engine, perfect gear to speed ratio, pick up and devil look at night, gives you all reason to be proud of."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,BEAST,2,"At the price point at which the Pulsar 220F is available, there is no other bike which can challenge the abilities of the Pulsar 220F for being a 200cc+ motorcycle below 1-lakh mark. However, the one motorcycle which tries to match the credentials of the Pulsar 220F is the Hero Karizma.  Overall value for money product, when it comes to packaging of the product in the sub-1 lakh price bracket. Offering a gazillion of equipment along with a punchy engine under its skin in this price range is certainly a good feat for the motorcycle."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,The Sportish Bike,4,"Adopting an aggressive stance in the crowded consumer motorcycle market, Bajaj introduced another surprise with the announcement of a brand new Pulsar model – the Pulsar 220F DTS-i. Billed as ‘the Fastest Indian’, it looks as though Bajaj are looking to capture drivers’ imaginations with high-spec technology and blistering performance.

Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Comfortable and Smooth,4,"I had already rode Bajaj Pulsar 150,180 and 135.Considering all the mentioned i found that Bajaj pulsar 220F is best of all in the category of comfort and smooth ride. I have Bajaj pulsar 220f since 6 months and i am very much satisfied with its comfort, speed, and the performance of engine."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,A ride to remember,4,"I own the first fastest Indian – Pulsar 220, the bike that opened the gates for all the bikers out there waiting for some power to thrill and style to show-off. My red beast is pretty quick and efficient as it reaches out a top speed of 143kmph and returns me a mileage of around 35kmpl. I have a knack of riding fast and when you have 220, the habit stays for long. The appearance of the bike is quite aerodynamic, which simply complements the true power of the engine and makes me go gaga about it. From projector headlight to LED tail lamp, this machine is truly designed to blow the minds. Fat rear tyre with disc brake makes it possible to stop this machine at a speed of 80kmph or so in seconds."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Extraordinary Bike,5,"My name is Gopi ,I m from A.p , My rating For Pulsar 220 is 5 out of 5. Front look with the projector lamp is something which will make you stand out in the traffic. Side look takes the rating away as you will feel there is something missing near your bike's engine. Exhaust gives one extra star if you are a fan of big exhaust. Rear look is very much similar to other pulsars and that makes it very common look on the road. For those who love the signature tail light of pulsar, will like this also. There is nothing to be differentiated w.r.t. rear end of the bike with other pulsars except its exhaust which is also similar to p180."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Very good bike.,5,"The bike is a looker, no doubt on that from my side. The quality of the plastic parts are also quite nice. They have lasted me for a long time, although I had changed the rear seat cowl about 5-6k Kms back as the screwing joints had broken and I had no other option but to fix it, as it had started rattling at certain speeds . Then I had a problem of the rubber bushes that was supposed to keep the side panels tight in their position falling off when ever I removed the side panels for regular cleaning of battery terminals and air filter.  Apart from that there wasn’t a problem I had faced with the fiber part."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Powerful Beast,3,"My Pulsar is two years old, its front headlight unit housing a projector lamp makes it stand out in the traffic. Side of the bike is muscular and the rear end is similar to other versions of Pulsar. Pulsar needed an all new design because everyone had got bored with its similar old look, the all new series of the bike is having totally different designing and looks, the bike is attracting a large crowd. If you are taking care of bike’s maintenance at regular intervals, you will have good time with your bike. Engine is very smooth and the monster generates a large amount of power. You can feel the sound of this beast while driving it at higher speeds. There is no bike available at such a low price with this much power. Its fuel economy is pretty good adding a positive point in its favour. I drive my bike daily, my average travelling is about 45 kilometers per day. I drive it fast but smooth, rough riding reduces the life of the bike."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Fast Indian,5,"It is the first bike of my life and I love it more than anything else in my life, however, my friends say this as I don’t give my bike to them. I bought this bike a few years ago, in school, my father gifted it to me on my 18th birthday, before that I used to ride Activa to school, which I hated the most as loved riding bikes. It was a great deal to me buy the fastest Indian as it was heavy and most powerful machine in the market as per my knowledge. I bought a Black Pulsar 220 Dtsi and it was like a dream come true to ride it to school everyday. "
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Catch me if you can,5,"I have recently bought Pulsar 220 as I had a budget of around Rs. 95k and I had options like Gixxer, Karizma, Avenger and Pulsar 220. I chose to put my money on Bajaj because it was offering the most powerful bike in my Bajaj with projector headlamps and disc brakes at both the ends. Fat tubeless tyre and an amazing semi-fairing made my day when I first saw it. Therefore, I cancelled all the other options and decided to stay on this brutal machine. The average of the machine is around 45kmph, if ridden properly and with so much power I can just cruise easily at 60kmph. "
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,About Pulsar 220 F ,5,"220 F  has a great power. Mine is new one, purchased on March 2011. It's pickup is super. Its super smooth engine makes you happy while riding it. Its power can pull the bike fastly in busy traffic. Fuel economy, they say(company) it gives 40 +, but I don't think so, its above 35 but not above 40 and If I am Talk About Look so In Grey color 220 F Was Looking Super,awesome. Really Thanks to Make a Pulsar 220 F Bajaj (Company)."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,A nice purchase for me,4,I purchased Bajaj Avenger 220 DTS-i on 06-Oct-2013 and have driven it 1500 Km by today. It has given me 50+ Km. per litre of mileage in realistic conditions. I commute daily from Faridabad to Gurgaon covering 80 Kms of distance. 
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,bahaj pulsar 220f dtsi,4,"When I planned to purchase a new bike, I shortlisted some best bikes available in the market. 1. Apache RTR 160 (Double Disk) 2. Pulsar DTS-i 150 3. Trigger 150 (Double Disk) 4. FZS V2.0. These all bikes are best in their class. I want to purchase a bike which should be good in city mileage, with great comfort and in a medium price range. After a long research I found that Pulsar is the only bike which can provide me these features in a good price range. So let's look about the features of Pulsar 150 DTS-i. Pros: 1. MILEAGE - When we plan to purchase a new bike our first priority is its mileage. There is no doubt about the Pulsar's mileage that, it provide 50 KMPL in city. 2. COMFORT - The sitting position of this bike too good and its suspension is also good as it work good on bad roads and off road. 3. HANDLING - Bajaj has improved the handling in this bike which make this bike in great control in market ride and good stability on high speed. 4. ENGINE- The new pulsar has a improved engine than the old one. The sound feels good. RATING:- Design and Style- 8/10 Instrument Console- 8.5/10 Engine & Performance- 8.5/10 Comfort while Riding- 9/10 Mileage- 9/10 Brakes and Suspension- 9/10 Ride and handling- 9/10 Price- 8/10"

No one will beat you then , cause they can't"
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Regular maintenance needed,3,"The bike is smooth in running but its gearbox is something that you have to maintain regularly. Gearbox problem costs me something at every service. On the other hand, its engine gives you so much of confidence on the road that you feel like you are riding a more superior vehicle. At a stretch, I have driven it for 380 kilometers, only problem I faced after the journey was sore shoulders, the soreness remained for a couple of days. Even after one and a half years of regular riding of my bike, the bike feels like new every time you climb on it for a ride. There are some areas of improvement like rear brake can be better for providing optimum safety and sudden stopping. It could have been given an all new rear view to offer an all new design to the 220cc monster. The rear view mirrors are also slightly tough to adjust. My name is Gautam Pandey and I will suggest you to buy this bike. Other than this, you can go for Pulsar 200 RS, NS and AS for all new looks."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Best bike with nice budget,5,"Here comes the brand new Pulsar 220f, having a 220cc engine with a roaring 21.04bhp power! The new p220f does not contain the fuel injection which has given a bhp more to that old p220. The torque generated by the engine is so impressive that you would just have a broad smile on your face while riding it.The bike can pull at 25-30 km/hr at the 5th gear very easily!This bike can hit the road at more than 144km/hr speed which makes us the fastest Indian! The p220f when compared to the karizma zmr and yamaha r15 in the section of styling.it lags behind like anything but still it has an aggressive look.It has got a very wide rear tyre which is not present in the r15.The p220 has got a 230mm disc in the rear and a 260mm disc in the front which makes the braking ability of the bike ""superb""!The bike is very comfortable in the city and the best thing about it is when on sitting behind you can feel the power of the bike.This bike can roll from 0-60 in 3.29sec! Now comes the very importat part of the fuel efficiency.this bike if driven carefull between 40-50km/hr .then gives average of 45-50kmpl and if driven recklessly then it would give about an average of 30-35kmpl at most but would not go under 30kmpl. This bike is a lot cheaper than the r15 and zmr.it costs around R.s.82, 000.The bike has got a very tiny rear view mirror from which looking behind to the traffic is almost impossibe! And also they vibrate like anything when hitting the road more than 120km/hr!The p220f has got the projector head lamps which is just superb!The bike is heavy in corners and when have passed the corner.is much stable.I took a test ride of about a 2km and felt that this bike contains all the features which we need in a bike. All over the best bike according to me with the price budget. Thank you. Regards , Rajkishore Mohapatra"
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Road Ruler of the Year...!,5,"Bajaj has announced that is able to meet consumer’s demands despite no signs of the month-long strike at their Chakan plant cooling down. They have said that they had managed to reach the required targets until Monday (July 22). Bajaj manufactures the KTM, Pulsar and Avenger motorcycles at the Chakan plant.The 220 was launched in 2007 , This bike with its sporty looks and killer performance easily stole the limelight and redefined performance biking in India. But it came at a Price. So naturally, it wasn’t a commodity that every person could dream off. Nonetheless, It was and still is a wonderful machine, I know a few friends who still use this machine with over 90k clicks on the ODO and the machine is still healthy as a horse, which easily destroys the Taboo, that the pulsar engine lasts only for a maximum of 2 years and nothing above 25k kms. It’s true, there is a taboo that the pulsars don’t last much long.Now I got my Bike on March 2010. The parts that attracted me the most, the looks(I was a sucker for the twin projector headlights, the LED console), the touring friendly ergonomics, the power and torque and then the killer price tag. All in all it was the perfect vehicle, Complete Value for Money product and it was still a rare machine in my locality, all the more reason to opt for this bike."

Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,THE KING OF BIKES!!!!,5,"Having one of the most powerful engine of its class offers great riding comfort and giving highest output. Pulsar was my 2nd bike and I have always been a fan of pulsar for its racing throttle and the ground clearance to speed pick up. Most efficient bike because of the combustion of fuel and air mixture, it offers some great startability and better torque. It comes at a price of Rs.88382. This new generation pulsar has a lot within it to be loved. It comes in with a sleek and sporty design, offers great riding comfort even for the person sitting behind.  It has set up a hard task for other manufacturers with its design language having a wolf-eye headlamps, modern looking fairings and wider tubeless tyres. Its just so awesome that one cant resist to have it. Pulsar 220 is worth a buy within the range of a lakh.  If you don't take medicine when you are unwell then you will suffer and the same goes for the bike, whenever its needed do the needful and then I'm pretty sure you wont have any problems in the longer run.

I dont always speed up for the 150kmph tag line but my more normal speeds are in between 80-100kmph. I also take my bikes feed back into consideration when I want to speed up as you all know, Pulsars are very intuitive.

The battery is really impressive till now I have never faced any problem to start the bike, just one press of button and engine is roaring. In rain I faced the problem of start, my bike was not starting at signal. There was no kick and I was really in panic. I took the bike aside put it in netural and the bike started. Yes someting this happens specially in rains that you bike will not start in gears else starting the bike is just fun. I live Up where there is bumper to bumper traffic and bikes handling is gud. Just it takes littler larger space for U-turn. It does not require much of maintenance, just because of my riding style I need to change the OIL every 5000-7000 kms (i ride very rough and most of the time above 100 and long drives). I face problem of gear being hard when the engine OIL is OLD but just replacing the oil solves the problem. In the drive of 18000+ kms, only one my clutch plates were destroyed. I replaced it for 1600 Rs. And this was since my brother does lot of stunt with bike so there is lot of pressure on clutch and grear. Couple of times he has submerged the bike in muddy area putting immense pressure on engine to come out of it. But the engine never ditched him. This game was part of challenge. Breaks are really just excellent, I come to halt from 130 kms/hrs to 0 kms/hrs with in few seconds without skidding my bike. In my job there much travelling involved and I think this is the best of best bike for me."

New BS4 engine is more refined than the previous one and the engine feels much smoother after first service (used Motul engine oil and rightfully engine warranty is void because of this!). Power delivery is linear and for a moment you feel like it's a fuel injected bike. Breaking is sufficient enough to stop the bike confidently at 80kmph. Like any other bikes, vibration is very common but it does not make a bite to irk you. Overall a good package for 1.1lakh price with no compromise! "

I always like the journey. Even at high speeds, the bike feels quite stable on the road and has superb handling.

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Power supply is fair,4,"This engine, in contrast to the other Pulsars, is not overly harsh and has a decent level of refinement. Power supply is often fairly linear and predictable. There isn't any bottom-end power, though. In first gear, I stalled the bike a few times. You get the impression that you are pushing the Pulsar RS200 in second gear."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Best Bike,5,The proper combination of a sporty and naked bike. Good fuel efficiency. Speed is enough according to this segment. You can use it as a long ride bike and also city ride bike. Ground clearance is good for off-road.

Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Bajaj Pulsar RS 200 Is An Aggressive Bike,4,"Let us agree that Bajaj Pulsar RS200 is an aggressive and muscular-looking sports bike that is capable of too low to mid-level of touring, as the RS200 still lacks that high-level performance. The Pulsar RS 200 has a unique set of styling and distinctive features, especially the front profile as it looks like a face and the pillion seat height is too much above the ground causing discomfort while driving. I think it was the purpose of Bajaj to overdo the design and make it look spectacular so that young audiences consider it based on looks."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Best Ever Bike,5,"The best bike ever with exceptional performance, more power, good pickup, impressive mileage, and an appealing design."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,The Bike Is Very Powerful,4,"The bike is very powerful and looks like a monster. I feel that the bike is truly awesome, and whenever you ride the bike, it grabs most people's attention."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Average looking Pulsar,4,"It is just one of the average-looking bikes with all the fiber plastic body around, which makes it look cheap and kills the feel of the Pulsar. The color of the bike fades on its own, a glitch in the gear can be felt, and sometimes I have to kick-start my bike and whatnot. I would not suggest anyone buy this bike."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Good Performance,4,"Good bike with excellent performance, it's all about performance within budget."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Awesome Performance,4,"The bike looks awesome on roads, and its aerodynamic fairing makes it more beautiful, If we talk about the power it gives non-ending power supply from the engine, no one can beat the beast in this segment."
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Stylish Bike,4,Stylish bike with good mileage and nice performance. It has a nice pick-up and runs smoothly at high speeds.
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Good Performance,4,"It has a sporty look with a sharp and edgy design that makes it stand out from other bikes. The bike has a top speed of 140 kmph and can go from 0 to 60 kmph in just 3.9 seconds. It also has a comfortable riding position and good handling capabilities. Overall, the Pulsar RS 200 is a great bike for those who want a powerful and stylish machine."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Best model of Bajaj Pulsar,4,"The best part is the price range as it was in the affordable line for me. It has the most dashing appearing look and I liked the extra body coverage on the fuel tank. Though I believe the white color is a bit of a turn-off. Apart from that gear shifting is very easy and smooth, and so is the engine performance. I would rate it four stars out of five."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Looks kept at minimum,5,"There was a lot of rumor going around regarding NS`60 being the average in quality and having an old instrument cluster but I find everything to be just fine. The fit and finish were good and looks were kept at a minimum. What matter are the mileage, and I got 40kmpl of mileage which is excellent."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Test drive of NS 160,4,"I took two test drives from different showrooms to differentiate whether the bike has some problems or the showroom people had some issues with the bike. But later to my surprise, it was the bike issue, the build-up quality and the overall fit and finish is too poor. So is the performance on-road I would not recommend anyone buy it."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Refined engine experience,5,"It runs on a 160.3cc single-cylinder engine capacity with an oil-cooled and four-valve head to give support. And it gives 17.3bhp with 14.6Nm torque, which is quite good so it all combines and gives a good refined engine experience. Overall I like the bike. "
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Not great fit and finish,3,It is quite similar to other sibling models and quite poor in terms of delivery. The paint smudges off and the fit and finish are not up to the mark. The price is also on the higher side even though it has nothing to offer to a customer. Being from a family of Pulsar is not going to make a cut for every bike.
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Once a legend always legend 220f,5,"Bajaj pulsar 220f the best bike in India. Speed, mileage, braking system outstanding, performance no one bike can beat this"

Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Bajaj Pulsar 220 F Excellent Power,3,"It has a nice road grip, and excellent power. The bike is safest because we can control it in any situation, and very good look."

Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,must buy bike in this segment,5,Good bike in this price segment with best average and mileage and the pick is is also really good go for it if you want to buy the 200 cc bike and your budget is low then you can go with this bike and the service cost is also very cheaper because this bike belongs to the Bajaj.
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Bajaj Pulsar 220F is an excellent sports bike,5,"It combines comfort and speed for its riders. It has a very radical design and aesthetic as well as cutting-edge functionality. Front and rear disc brakes, a digital instrument panel, a clip-on handlebar, and supportive seats are all features of the Pulsar 220F. The suspension is strong, and the handling and ride quality is excellent."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,this bike is king of all bikes at this price ,5,Pulsar 220 is my first bike. I have chosen this bike for its best performance and great durability. It's been more than 6 years since I am riding this bike and have completed small and big road trips. I have never felt any problem while riding my bike only thing I can say bajaj the quality is not up to the mark but there is a solution for that we can keep our bike in the best condition and time-to-time services. In final I can say that it's worth the power and an amazing look at this price rest depends on how you ride it.
Bajaj Pulsar RS200,4.5,Eye Catching Athletic Styling,4,"It's been a thrilling trip since I recently became the happy owner of the Bajaj Pulsar RS200. The bike attracts attention on the road because of its athletic styling and the choice of three eye-catching colors. The 199.5-cc BS6 2.0 engine offers strong performance and incredible acceleration. The superb stopping ability of the disc brakes on the front and rear wheels increases safety. The 166 kg weight of the bike makes it seem sturdy and steady while being ridden. Long journeys may be taken without frequent replenishment because of the 13-liter fuel tank capacity. Although the Pulsar RS200's price of Rs. 1.72 Lakh may seem high, the excitement it provides makes it worth every cent."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Two test drive experiences,5,"I have not heard good remarks from my friends who took it for many tests drive. So I thought, I will be able to make a better judgment if I'm considering buying this. So I took two test drives, and I completely agree with my friends. It is not worth spending so much money as performance wise it is just an average bike."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Stunning Bike,4,"The Pulsar NS160's handling qualities are equally stunning as its engine performance which is quite exciting. The motorbike has a rapid turn-of-speed due to its perimeter frame and relatively stiff suspension adjustment. Given how easy it is to flick it about in traffic, it is very fun. Things are only made more fluid by the mild steering."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Strong Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4,"Bajaj Pulsar NS 160 is a daily commute sports bike with sharpy features and modern updates. So far, my experience has been good and satisfactory. The braking system is strong so is the pick-up. Even being a small cc engine capacity it delivers great performance. "
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Worth buying Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4,"Many factors can make anyone more inclined towards NS 160, such as the price is affordable, ABS, clear lens cleaner, AHO, and excellent mileage. So why anyone would not want to invest in classic and the most stylish bikes offered in the Pulsar segment. "
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Pulsar NS160's style is unquestionably outdated,5,"Bajaj Pulsar NS160 nonetheless looks athletic and young. Its low posture and aggressive design lines give it a streetfighter-like appearance. With a white frame and wheels, the bike's most recent version comes in new colour variations that seem considerably bolder and eye-catching."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Good Bike,4,"The driving experience is great good pick and mileage, and the best engine we can see in pulsar bikes in the segment."
Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4.6,Perfect Machine,4,"A smooth machine and built quality are very strong, perfect weight-to-power ratio. The best option for beginners who wants to follow their passion for riding"
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Ordinary Bike,4,"The quality of the Pulsar NS160 is ordinary. it is certainly not the greatest in its class. There are no uneven panel gaps and the plastic bodywork is of decent quality. However, Bajaj could have improved the paint job a little. On the frame of our test bike, we could see that the white paint was getting messy and smeared out. Additionally, several of the panels had already begun to rattle softly."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Overall Performance Is Good,5,The overall performance of this bike is good as compared to other bikes in that segment and the new look in the 160 variant is really best with beast performance. Dual channel Abs system and front side down suspension is the best combination with the new beast look. Compared to other bikes in that segment I think ns 160 is the best choice for all. Without question go for it and enjoy your best riding journey.
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,This Bike Is Really Good,5,This bike is really good. It's comfortable. good handling and setting. this bike is really good power. I am so happy.

Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,The NS160's ergonomics are cosy,5,"Its riding position exudes a feeling of dedication that makes it interesting. The bike's seat height is around 805mm, making it the highest in its sector. But even for shorter riders, mounting the bike shouldn't be an issue at all."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Very Comfortable,5,I found it very comfortable and very easy to ride. I was searching for good bikes under my budget and I did not find any better option than Bajaj Pulser NS160. Mileage is very budget-friendly.
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Good Bike,5,"The bike is good, and the power is the best. It's the best in the segment, and it's a crazy combination of power and mileage."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Subtle Changes In Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4,"The Bajaj has changed the way we used to look at Pulsar segment bikes as slowly older and small-engine bikes are going through a makeover change. And the new looks of Bajaj Pulsar NS 160 are quite distinctively appealing because the first colour in which I saw the NS 160 was white. Of course, Bajaj had to appear with NS 160. The good thing is that the small 160cc engine is priced so well and budget-friendly, that even I wanted to buy it. But I already own a different bike. And I wish Bajaj could have launched this muscular and stylish bike earlier."
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Good Bike,4,"I have been riding for the past 3 years, and I am glad to share my experience with you. Bajaj has created a fully loaded and well-controlled machine that feels like a jet when I ride it. This bike makes me feel like a pilot."
Bajaj Pulsar 125,4.2,Good Performance,4,"I purchased Bajaj Pulsar 125 in 2020, I was impressed by the design and the performance of the bike. I liked every feature of the bike but many people find it difficult to handle because of its heavy weight and sporty performance. After 2 years of heavy usage, it gives a mileage of 40-45 km, and pickup, and comfort is amazing. Talking about the aftersales service I'd say I haven't been to the mechanic except for routine servicing and in my area it costs approx ₹1500-2000 for servicing so it's not too much. If you're looking for a budget-friendly beast you can go for it blindly. But I'd recommend using this before buying if anyone (friends, family, neighbor) has it. Then you'll get the exact idea of whether it is suitable for you or not."
Bajaj Pulsar 125,4.2,Good Bike,4,It is a good bike and its ride is very smooth and comfortable it is the best bike on this budget and its looks are very good.

The bike additionally has a snug seating role and desirable suspension, making it a cushy ride even on tough roads. The build fine is ideal, and the motorbike feels strong and well-built. Overall, it's an extremely good"
Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4.4,Ride Quality Is Superb,4,"Bajaj Pulsar NS160 Even though the suspension is precisely the same, right down to the spring rates, the ride quality is still fairly nice but not quite as cushy as the NS200. Particularly when riding over the sharp edge of a pothole, the slight but noticeable hardness in the ride is felt towards the rear. However, we left the standard preload settings alone, and the NS160 weighs roughly 8 kg less than the NS200. When the preload has been properly set and the passenger boards, we believe the ride quality will increase."
Bajaj Pulsar 125,4.2,Mid Range performance - Bajaj Pulsar 125,4,"The Pulsar 125 provides acceptable low and mid-range performance. It doesn't struggle anywhere in the rpm range for a 125. It pulls cleanly, handles inclines with ease, and if you take it out on the highway, it will easily reach 80-90kmph. The Pulsar 125 will not win any accolades for its ride or handling, but it is a simple bike to manage in the city. It's light and nimble, and it's simple to park. "

Bajaj Pulsar 125,4.2,Pulsar 125 Engine Is Quiet,4,"The Bajaj Pulsar 125's engine is quiet, sophisticated, and moderately powerful. Its qualities as a well-rounded commuter motorbike are considerably strengthened by its exceptional riding quality and impressive steadiness. The main drawback is that the design is far too generic and resembles the Pulsar 150 Neon. However, the Pulsar 125 may benefit from that tactic as it boasts comparable engaging performance and similar proportions to the larger Pulsar 150 but in a more fuel-efficient design."
Bajaj Pulsar 125,4.2,Good Experience ,4,1. Buying experience is very good. 2. Riding experience is good but the gearbox is not smooth. When we shift to 2nd gear there is an annoying sound and so much neutral false 3. My bike is spilled seat disc variant and black-red color and it looks awesome 4. Maintenance of this bike is good but servicing experience is below average.
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Satisfactory Experience - NS200,4,"The NS200 is available from Bajaj in three colors grey, blue, and white which is my favourite all of which have a white frame and wheels. Now, both the paint quality and the body panels' fitting are excellent. Nowhere did it appear that there were any holes or incomplete work. Even the polymers themselves are of good grade. However, the switchgear's fit and feel might have been far better."
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Bike performance and overall view.,3,"The bike mileage is pretty good compared to Duke as well as its looks are amazing, simple, and decent which helps boys to convince their parents apart from that the clutch of NS is super smooth which helps riders to control easily, if I talk about performance and overall view so at this price it is the best sport bike to purchase."
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Expected some changes -Pulsar NS 200,3,"I did expect some minor if not major changes in NS 200 but the new Pulsar NS 200 came with the same design. It might attract some but not going to influence a lot of people as people like me were expecting changes. Although, its maintenance cost and price are factors worth considering."
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Need Improvements - Pulsar NS 200,4,"My friend has an older version of NS 200, and to see the difference in the new facelifted version we booked a test drive. The bike is somewhat the same in design and style, but the handling has been improved as all the buttons are quite handy and grabby. But it still has that same vibration feeling, so nothing much has changed. "
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Modified is Good,5,"The Bajaj Pulsar NS200 has all the modifications required. The 2021 version, however, shares the same appearance as the earlier design. And it still seems enticing to me. It has the unique split tail lamp that is synonymous with the Pulsar series, a striking headlamp with two pilot lamps, and a muscular fuel tank with noticeable lines and creases."
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Pulsar NS 200 - good color options,5,"I eagerly awaited for Bajaj Pulsar NS 200 update in expectation of sharp and innovative features, and I was thrilled at the striking colour options that were provided.

Everybody will get confused either it is a 125cc bike or 150cc pulsar. If someone changes the 125cc sticker with a 150cc sticker, nobody will be able to differentiate between them.

We simply can't ride it on 1 to 3 gears as the bike vibrates too much and we feel uncomfortable. It has a fair amount of pickup in the 3-4 gears. Again in 5-6 gears, its power delivery is linear and gradually when it goes past 90kmph, it starts to pick up and then it runs amazingly fast and reaches 130kmph easily. The problem is when we drive in the city. I ride only in the city and I find it really difficult as the bike needs constant gear changes. Also, the bike gives new problems after every 2000-3000kms.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,The best naked bike ,4,"To all those out here fond of riding and enjoying their rides, i only have a review that is actually how I felt having this bike as my first bike.  Frankly speaking, I enjoyed the bike at it's lowermost and the highest rpm on the bike it's A pleasure that Bajaj introduced it again after discontinuing it. If I talk about the buying experience it was a great day that I totally choose the bike according to my rigorous riding altitude but as far as it is concerned when I purchased my bike for all others, my family member's it was a bike but for me it was like that i bought my dream of riding a bike. I always wanted to have a bike so I felt glad that now I can ride enjoy each moment and understand what pure riding adrenaline is. Secondly, if I talk about the riding experience the bike is a gem and a masterpiece in itself happy to have it. Riding is smooth and there is no loss of confidence when hitting corners but ensure that you have good tires. Which is the most important part?   Mileage: usually don’t keep too much track of the mileage. But I have observed that it varies from 30 to 35 kmpl. here are no issues in riding comfortably for rider except the pillion. If you take long rides just ensure that you will have to take several halts as the pillion behind you won't be comfortable for long. Taking you towards the details and performance the bike as my title says it justifies the title for sure. Most of you must be aware of the fact that the bike ns 200 was designed by edger heinrich. There is nothing that people don't know about ns 200 it is like the looks or the design helps the high-speed aerodynamics cutting edge technology that helps bike flow like water. But you will feel wind blast after a certain limit of speed which is not appropriate according to me as it would lead to certain problems. Like issues in high-speed handling. Performance is the best part ns 200 is remembered for its top end and how the bike performs on the track. The bike can be a good option for all thinking to get performance and average and thus keeping the maintenance in mind.There is no high cost that could affect your pocket but yes if you opt for engine oils like motul fully synthetic a little increase would be there in the cost.Pros fo the bike is that it can go anywhere you want and never feels like the bike is stressed. More importantly, the bike is maneuverable easy to handle and enjoy a safe ride. Now let's talk about the con""s of the bike there is a little vibration on the handlebar. Which is not good for such a legend.Hope that Bajaj is reading this. Probably this is the cons I came to know about the bike. It is like Bajaj can make this legend furthermore great by launching it in upper-class engine segment. "

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Value for Money ,5,I have purchased recently ABS model and I drove it & gave 55km
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Very Comfortable Bike,5,Awesome & comfortable bike. I drive like a devil move like a legend. Maintenance costs also in very low. NS200 highway cruising is better than city commute as the engine heats up in city and vibrations come over 120kmph & so suspensions are stiff so have to take care of the bumps rest all is fine seating isn't too committed will require some getting used to with the rear set footrest but it doesn't hurt the ankle. If it is discomforting for you then see for the apache it is more upright than ns200. 
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Excellence ,5,Its very good condition and better than Duke bike best of the price.
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Reviw of Pulsar 200Ns after 50K Km driven,5,The best performer in the segment if you are thinking about a rough tough bike with superior control than there is no competition with Pulsar 200NS in the same budget. you never feel any lag and you will always enjoy overtakes. I purchased this machine in 2012 after 6 years of use I had driven almost 50K km. But after the 50K Km driven the maintenance cost of this vehicle is similar to a small hatchback car. And due to the liquid colling system i get a avg. milage around 35 Km/Lit. which is fair with the 200CC engine.  
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,The Speed she goes,5,"I am just a big fan of the Ns200 everything is so great about this bike. The sexy looking skull body, the speed and mileage everything is amazing."
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Thanks to Bajaj Pulsar ns 200 bike owsome bike,5,Awesome bike speed bike full advanced technology used good for all Indians in 200 segment.
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Excellent Bike.,5,Great Speed & braking efficiency is also good. Best bike & excellent colours options.
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,This Bike is for Fun &amp; Adventure,5,"I have owned the first generation NS200 and also have experienced the fun factor of the latest one. It was and it is always the best in the segment. It was a revolutionary motorcycle when it was initially launched back in 2012. Let's us see the fund fact of mighty NS. Though it was developed on the KTM Duke 200 platform, it has created it's own kingdom and legacy. Till 2012, youngsters in India doesn't have a better any best option to explore and show their full potential to do stunts. It has given wings to fly and the freedom to explore. Coming to design, with robotic headlight, bigger tank, 3 piece handle, perimeter frame and other elements gave it a fresh look and made it better to handle. NS has taken advantage of the perimeter frame, which helps you to carry more speed in corners. The 200CC engine kicks out 23 HP of peak power at 9.5K RMP and 18 N.M at 8K RPM. I feel it quick in low and mid-range and bit leaner at higher RPM. The liquid cooling system helps the engine not to heat quickly and to cool down from high temperature quickly, which gives the rider a long range if riding distance without stopping. The triple spark technology gives it a very good fuel economy, engine life and better response. But the saddest part is the vibes at higher RPM, they are miserable but overall it's fun to ride. I feel Bajaj would have done a better job in terms of build quality, which it has done in the latest version but not up to the mark. It is the best in class, Bajaj could have upgraded this with USD suspension set up at the front, DOHC set up and other quality-driven elements rather than doing cosmetic changes, of course, the new body graphics, belly pan added more beauty to it. The breaking set in the first generation NS200 was bit poor which has been improved and upgraded with ABS in the latest version. In terms of handling the bike, it's fun to ride on highways as well as the close corners of roads. Tyres are doing a decent job, but if want has more fun you can upgrade to some better ones. Bajaj has always given a promised fuel economy across all its Pulsar lineup (even all the bikes from Bajaj), so as the NS. In the initial days there no experts at the service centres, so have to struggle with my NS even for minor problems, but now Bajaj is good. it is one of the best options that you can consider in its segment, the latest version is more reliable and more value for money. "
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4.6,Great Powerful Engine and Performance Bike and Absolute Value for Money,4,"First things First..Being an Indian what we look fro is Value for money (That applies to 80% of Indians)..Coming down to the Subject, its a Great Bike..When I say great it means Amazing Power, Great handling, Smooth Engine, Good Mileage and Great COMFORT..So to keep it simple If your Budget is not that high and You want a Great Powerful Engine and Performance Bike..This one is for You (Hands Down)..Its much better than Pulsar 220F as that too heavy and also Noisy..Kudos to Bajaj"

Earlier was having an old Maestro which is with me for 5 years and never faced any issue, no engine-related work and smooth performance so decided to go for another hero scooter. So I choose pleasure+ as a lightweight and easy to ride/handle product so that everyone in the family can use it smoothly including my younger sisters. Along with that good performance of engine also there as 110cc is there. As per my experience in one year it’s giving great mileage and comes with a very stylish look & features. More importantly, after-sales support is excellent as the hero is having a great reach of the network's and very trustworthy brand so when we shifted to Jaipur from our earlier place we faced no issues related to free services & 5-year warranty (not used as yet but dealership promised they will help no need to worry). It will help me in gaining good resale value too by chance if I choose to switch to another hero product. Now Pleasure+ coming with more looks and bold style along with Xsens and FI technology. On riding also it is good, sometimes you can feel not as a bike but that’s perfectly normal with every scooter, no need to worry about that. So overall it's great value for money especially if you are looking for a family scooter which can ride on all kinds of roads."

Having been on the market for several years, the bike has undergone several upgrades and improvements to its design and features."
Hero HF 100,3.9,Good product but the package needs improvement ,3,Am 6 feet and the bike is small for a full-sized two adults. The seat is small. The performance is as per the need but the mileage expectation is not met. The kick start is not as efficient as the kick size is not ergonomically comfortable. The cost-cutting is of the level that even the side mirror added to the model is so small as there are of no use. Breaks have good biet CBS works well but the tire size is too slim. So they often get a slip. There is a lot to improve in the package. Maybe to meet the pricing need the same is done but still I would like to spend a bit more if the changes are done. These all are utility points and of regular usage.

Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Best in class.,5,"Ride almost 1000 km, no mechanical issues yet but few electrical problems like the horn and turn indicator sound. 1st service is done, service timing is too much irritating almost 5 to 6 hours. Because of too much working loads at the service centre. The bike is running very smooth, pick up is decent in city commuting, 9 BHP is sufficient for me in city riding. Average almost 50 km/litre approximately. Build quality of this bike is best in the segment. Suspension is very good. Its rear tyre should be wider that is definitely a downside and its turn indicator is made of hard plastic which is also a downside according to me. Braking is very good and it's IBS (integrated braking system) working properly. i3S is also working when required, when we stop on traffic lights or crowded area."
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Super Splendor Best In Its Class.,5,"Hero Super Splendor has low maintenance with good mileage. Overall, it's a good bike for daily use. Moreover, it is light weighted so it's good in traffic. It has a good pickup for one rider."

Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Best bike in this budget segment,5,"  I purchased the bike new model HHSS on 29.5.2011(Price Rs54, 144 on road including Rs.560 for helmet) . The choice was between Honda Shine, Suzuki Sling Shot and Super Splendor. On test drive I found shine didn't have the pick up; the power doesn't come fast enough. Sling shot has very smooth gear shift but the Super Splendor had the new looks and on test driving I found the power coming fast enough. So the pick up and good looks were the deciding factor. It is a good commuter bike for city."
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,SUPER SPLENDER GIVING75 KMPL,5," I have brought a HH Super Splendor(Black with Electric Purple Graphics) on 1st Jan 2012. Before my ride I was thinking that the bike will give me a 45-50KMPL mileage in the initial days till the 2nd -3rd service and afterwards it will be like 65+(as many people said to me and also the company guys), But giving me a unbelievable surprise the bike is giving me 80kmpl mileage consistently from the first day itself. I am commuting to my office -IMT Manesar from my Res. at Rajiv Chowk- Gurgaon on NH8 daily driving a constant speed of 45-48 KMPH. Till date I have completed 800 kms and also done 1st servicing, but there is no change in the mileage. it is still on the 80KMPL. I am extremely happy with the mileage it gives."

Hero Super Splendor,4.7,best ever bike,5,"I wish i could give it more than 5 stars. Best ever bike i have used. Also excellent bike for family also. Person of any age can ride this bike whether too young or too old. Bike for everyone. I have been using Super splendor for about 4-5 years. Excellent performance till now. Stylish look. Can withstand with other stylish bikes like pulsar discover,etc. Also the performance is amazing, its fuel efficiency is best as compared to any bike. Its fuel efficienct is around 50-60 kmpl. A bike with stylish looks, amazing performance and that much fuel efficiency is the need of every person. Moreover super splendor is better than splendor. Super splendor is very comfortable for short distances as well as long distances but i dont know about hilly routes. Pickup is good and engine is also good. Doesn't got heat up quickly. And main point prive is not too much high and can be bought by any middle class person. So overall best bike for middle class families with that much of facilities whether look, performance, price and its fuel efficiency amd maintenance. I am satisfied with this bike.. Thanks to hero for awesome bike."
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,hero super splender I smart ,3,Hope less bike fuel efficiency is  nil it gives only 35 km /ltr as claimed by the hero above 80 km. Very tall claims are made for its fuel efficiency but stands no where as compared to TVS OR  ROYAL EN FIELD.  IS MUST SAY THIS PEOPLE HIDE CERTAIN PARAMETERS AND SELL THE VEHICLE IN THE  MARKET.WE THE FOOL GO BY NAME HERO AND MAKE BLUNDERS AND SHED OUR HARD EARNED MONEY TO BUY THIS KIND OF TRASH
Hero Super Splendor,4.7, Best bike with pickup and mileage,4,"I have been using this bike since last five years, and it is  the best of all bikes. The pickup gears and smoothness gives a different feeling. The Honda super splendor, I would strongly recommend all to purchase it. It comes with superb graphics, broad seat, comfortable riding, gives me a mileage of 62 kmpl in cities and 67 kmpl on highways. I'm 58 kg may be the mileage would be. Initially I planned to buy honda shine but people said it will take 3 months for delivery and the price is higher but this machine exceeded my expectations.I am commuting to my office -IMT Manesar from my Res. at Rajiv Chowk- Gurgaon on NH8 daily driving a constant speed of 45-48 KMPH. Till date I have completed 800 kms and also done 1st servicing, but there is no change in the mileage. it is still on the 67KMPL. I am extremely happy with the mileage it gives."
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,"Hero Super Splendor: Mileage, Price, Review",4,"As i previously owned and like the Hero Splendor, I had to invest in Super Splendor just to feel how the 125 cc version of the bike works. I did like the reworked side panels and the LED tail lamp. The 125cc engine of Super Splendor is from the new Glamour. The 4 speed gearbox has also been taken from the Glamour with a few adjustments for rural riding. "
Hero Super Splendor,4.7, Super splnder most comfortable bike in 125 cc segment ...,5,Hii
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Bekar bike,1,Bekar bike hai mai ese le kr pachta rha hoo 
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Rahul Panwar's view,5, Superb bike with the best mileage and Solid body. A quite trustable bike from Hero.
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Superiors.,5,This bike is best in range of125cc for millage and comfort.
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Very nice bike,5,Nice mileage and nice pickup and stylish look bike. Quite budgeted bike for a normal living person.
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Excellent bike and good millage,4,"I bought super splendor bike before 5 months, millage is giving around 65kmpl, it has ASFS engine, it giving better millage and performance. I will enjoy at the speed of 80  and also giving smooth ride when compare to other 125cc bike.The during 1st five hundred kms I was told to drive at the most 40kmph by the show room.  I am around 58 kg may be thinking about the mileage would be problem. Initially I planned to buy honda shine but people said it will take 3 months for delivery and the price is higher but this machine exceeded my expectations.I will pay only low maintenance charge for oil change and other general services, which is one of the great bike in india.  I have already done 800kms and first service is also done but there is no change in the mileage it is still consistent on 80kmpl. The only problem is the gear shifting quiet tough but never feel when you use it frequently. I recommend hero super splendor to anybody who opt for mileage and comfort. I recommended this bike to my relations also."
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,does not look good but the best commuter,3,"Splendor Plus is the next offering from Hero MotoCorp after its most successful motorcycle Splendor. Splendor Plus was expected to have a good design that will make it stand out in the crowd but it was not like that. The bike is a basic commuter which is not designed for styling, it is only designed to produce the maximum mileage that is required make the rides economical for the users. The engine is smooth and maybe its the best in commuter segment bikes. The seat is long and quite comfortable so that long distances can be covered without being tired. The bike offers a mileage of 70 to 80 kmpl depending on the conditions and way of driving. I would like to recommend Splendor Plus to those who want a 100cc commuter. The bike is the best with its performance and maintenance cost is also very less, plus the service is only required at a proper gap of six months. It does not give any problems in between and can be trusted unlike other bikes."
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Great bike for daily usage,4,"I have bought this bike 6 months ago. I am quite satisfied with it. This bike is really fuel efficient & in budget. So far I haven't faced any problem with this bike. It has really large seat for comfortable driving as well as for the person at the back of driver. Its alloy ring gives it a elegant look. Build quality is also superb. I would become happy if its headlight would be bit stylish. Nowadays petrol price is really going higher, so if you want to save your valuable money, then just go for it. This bike will give total satisfaction where the issue is mileage. I would recommend this bike highly for daily usage."
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Two Wheel of Life,4,I bought hero bike 2 years ago .it is working good and fine. its average is 50 km/ltr. its look is awesome and still looks new.i think hero bikes are awesome. everyone should go for it. i love my bike. thank you for providing me space in review of my bike.bikedekho is good platform for bikers.it provide lot of information about bikes.i also use bikedekho.com 
Hero Super Splendor,4.7,low bugbett,5,"I have used Hero Honda splendoe for 10 years without any fuss. They are great built, consistent & excellent service support.That's the reason they are selling 5 lac+ bikes every month. In case of Bajaj Discover is the recently launched. You can't sell a product by just giving the names like DTSI & overhyping the average figures.Finally you have to prove it on road. Again they are having a very poor service support & nack of discontinuing their bikes without any prior notice. The new Passion pro is a soild bike with syle & performance clubbed together .Hero Splendor is the world's top selling motorcycle and the company has brought in multiple variants of this bike over time. The automaker recently brought out more interesting variants of the Splendor, including the iSmart which has start-stop technology and Splendor Pro Classic which is the world's cheapest cafe racer styled motorcycle.

Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Budget motorcycle with good performance,3,"Purchased this bike one year back and i am quiet satisfied till date. Vehicle still runs like as if I have bought it yesterday only. It gives immense pleasure to drive such a vehicle, i would recommend others to go for it if they don't want to spend too much of money and yet want to get a good quality ride. The performance of this bike is good. Being a college student I often ride along with two of my friends sitting behind me [although i don't recommend this] and the bike never disappoints me. It is very stable till 70km/h speed but if you go above that it vibrates a lot and makes a lot of noise which is not good and also not safe. The speedometer of my bike was once not working and the service centre took good care of that."

But it also have some cons, it dose not have a DC lighting like the Bajaj Discover bikes have, which gives constant light. Due to narrow rear Tyre control is not good on the bad patches of the road. But overall the bike seems OK. There is some doubt in my mind that is this excessive mileage would create any problem latter? Should I ask the service center guys to adjust for reducing the mileage? Please share your opinions!"

Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Good bike with some great feature,4,"Design and Style This bike has always been the most mature bike amongst all Splendor variants in terms of appearance. It’s a full size bike with decent looks. It’s been designed for everyone. At front, you can instantly notice its restyled tinted visor which suits the new graphics on its cowl. There is a gap in its cowl just below its headlight which differentiates it than others. Front mudguard has been extended from both sides around its front forks. The bike also features body coloured rear view mirrors and new clear lens indicators. Hero has used black colour on its alloy wheels, engine, rear grab rails and silencer. To enhance its look, Hero has fitted a chrome shield on its muffler which complements its chromed rear shock absorbers. Side panel and fuel tank features new characteristic graphics on them. Just below the fuel tank, it has chrome finishing on its utility box which can easily be noticed. It looks like most of the Hero bikes when seen from the back. Its rear fender and tail lamp are quite familiar. Engine and Gearbox This mono cylinder 125cc engine can also be seen its elder sibling, Glamour. It’s a four-stroke, air-cooled, OHC engine which pumps out a peak power of 9 bhp at 7000 rpm. The maximum torque output of this engine is 10.35 Nm which can be used at 4000 rpm. The same four speed manual gearbox with all gears up shift-pattern of Glamour makes its way to this bike. Acceleration and Performance There is hardly any difference in the performance of this bike and Glamour. In fact, you may feel its gear ratios a bit taller than Glamour for better fuel efficiency. It’s certainly not on the faster side but feels better than other 100cc bikes. Unfortunately it’s not as powerful as other 125cc rivals and that spoils the game in city traffic. The constant gear shifting may irritate you as the bike lacks power and its throttle response is also not very impressive. However what can impress you is the refinement level of this engine. It’s a very silent motor which promises you least noise and harshness at high speeds. It takes around 8 seconds to complete 0-60km/hr and after that it can reach to a top speed of 90km/hr which is also disappointing as even many 100cc bikes like Bajaj Platina manage to get a top speed of 95km/hr but it’s hard for this bike. Gear transitions are very smooth which is really helpful in city driving. The bike performs best between 3000-6000rpm and soon after that the power starts to taper off which is a big setback for this bike. Mileage There is a slight difference in the fuel efficiency of this bike and Glamour. Super Splendor seems to be more fuel efficient as it may deliver you a mileage of around 63-68km/ltr in city traffic while these figures may increase up to 5km/ltr on highways. Suspension and Brakes The familiar five step adjustable rear shock absorbers and telescopic front forks are supporting this bike. It’s a very competent suspension system which can be seen in many bikes of Hero. This bike has the potential to carry the weight of this bike without complaining. There is no option of disc brake in this bike as it features 130mm drum brakes on its front and rear wheel. Hero Super Splendor Ride and Handling This bike is lighter in weight in comparison to Glamour which improves its drive ability in city traffic. The light handling acts as a boon for city commuters. However on highways, the bike lacks stability due to rigid suspension system and small wheelbase (1265mm). Things become worse with its poor ground clearance of 150mm which makes it unsuitable for our nasty Indian roads. The bike is unstable around corners and its tyres find it hard to keep this bike grounded. An optional disc brake is missed badly at some situations where you need accurate control on this bike. Its ride quality would have improved significantly with the help of a disc brake."

Hero Super Splendor,4.7,Hero bike,5,My name is jitender saini and I have been using hero super splander 125 for last 3 years. I have used it for long drive it has given good mileage and riding on my super splander is  comfortable every time and in all seasons . it is really a great bike to trust even for slippery roads in rainy season.

Hero Super Splendor,4.7,My 1st bike super splendor(exciting),4,As the title suggests this is my 1st bike and very excited i was when i bought it a month before. i choose this one because of its decent looks and major factor its mileage. splendor series has been a success all over india. so i also joined the splendor family. now coming on to the main points. this bike has got bigger power of 125cc engine yhan its other models.The bike has a fuel tank that can hold 13 litres of petrol. It has also got the electtic start feature which we find in every high end bikes these days. I use it regularly for my journry from home to office it runs smoothly nice suspension. I also use it occasionaly for carrying 3 persons which is not allowed but sometimes with friends we need to do that so it handles that perfectly without any pblm faced. the alloy wheels are the cherry on top it loooks great with those alloys wheel. i have many more things to say but cant write a whole story in review overall i would like to conclude by saying its a great buy for a middle class working guy like me.

The bike looks attractive and the best part about it is it doesn't gets old in terms of looks. This is an upgraded version of Splendour I would say. It has more power/torque than Splendour and better looks than Splendour. But, has less mileage but you need not worry about it as the mileage that gives is sufficient enough as it is almost 55-60 km/hr. The bike's maintenance is almost zero if you keep it servicing regularly. It is also comfortable due to it's long seat. So, makes a good ride for two people. Stability is good up to 80 km/hr after that it get unstable a bit. Best for city riding purpose. It has a high resale value.and lasts long in better condition than Bajaj's any other similar range bike. It is a reliable ride.

I really liked this because its sound is lower than other bikes. I was happened to notice that it gives an awesome mileage, as this review was about a 2014 model vehicle (forgot to notify that it was the earlier times that hero Honda was separated). I think splendor is the first and foremost bike made after the partnership broke off from Honda company."

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,My Splendor,4,"It is a good bike. It is giving me average of around 65 KM/litre in city area. It has been a hassle free ride since beigining. The most efffective part of the bike is its gear system. The gear system is so smooth that when it runs it moves into fourth gear i can not realise it. Similarly the kick start is so much smooth that you can almost say that the bike is a half kick start bike. Braking part is also effective as it stops the bike within friction of time. There had been no problem with the engine till now. The riding of the bike in rough terrain is very good , the shock ups do not let u get any shocks from the rough terrain. The seating is also vey comfortable as well as the handle bars of the bike is also comfortable to get grip on. Although the lock mechanism needs to be evaluated as a lot of bikes in our city of the same make & model has been reported stolen, because the lock can be easily jacked in this make of bike. So the company should look into this matter seriously. Overall the bike is a good bike."

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,My favourite bike - splendor plus,4,I have been using this bike since 2009.

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Excellent pickup and best mileage,4,I purchased this bike in November 2013. I purchased this bike for the purpose of going to collage and then i used this for going to my office.This bike has the potential to control my daily spending of petrol because this bike has excellent pickup and best mileage among the bikes i had used till now. I almost saved rs 1000 from this bike in a month on my petrol spending.The best part about this bike is its displacement and price of the bike is very cost effective. i would recommend all of the users to go this bike for the daily purpose need. The maximum power of this bike is 8000 rpm and the maximum torque of this bike is 5000 rpm.This bike in both electric and kick start type. One thing the company should improve in this bike is its fuel tank size only. At present  
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,amazing bike,1,Amazing bike really I like it and give good mileage
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Reliable but just reliable.Good 1 for all time.,5,"Ride Quality: Smoothness is one of the best in its category. Engine is less noisy and ride is enjoyable. Power: A big let down, not at all satisfactory at low RPM, but gains momentum after 40 Km/h. Top speed is not being tested but engine begins to cry after 70 km/h and vibration creeps in. The bike becomes literally uncontrollable at higher speeds due to its light weight body. Mileage: It is consistently stable at 65 to 70 km/litre unless used roughly. Electrical: Again below par. The headlight is unable to spot objects at low beam. The high beam also lacks good focusing. Suspension & Tyres: The suspension system is well tuned for most of Indian roads. The tyres however need to wider for better traction during rains. Compared to others 100 cc bikes like Bajaj Platina and Discover 100 (which I have tried). Initial power and pickup of Platina is far superior to Splendor, however you will not get that smoothness in ride quality .."

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Very affordable bike by Hero MotoCorp,5,I purchased this bike on January 2012 when I was doing my engineering. Now I am doing Job but still the bike is giving me same performance which I was expecting from beginning. The bike is really extra ordinary as it is most sold bike for Hero MotoCorp. One best thing about this bike is its Mileage. It is giving me 75kmpl mileage when I purchased it and now it is giving me around 68kmpl. I think every middle class person can afford this bike as It cost me around 49000/-. I can ride this bike with smooth gear change and great ease. The maximum power of this bike is around 7000 rpm so I can easily reach at 90kmph. The weight of bike is very light and seat is also having good and stylish design. Two person can easily sit on bike. I have attached extra carrier on my bike so I can easily carry some stuff like vegetables. I am using it with regular maintenance service of Hero MotoCorp.  I have recommend this bike with all my relatives and friends.

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Nice bike,4,"bought my HERO splendor plus in September 2014, as of me it is a gud bike for all middle class set of people. I live in delhi where traffic is huge and the bike gives mileage of 60 to 65 depending upon how we use.. If we ride the bike below 45, the mileage goes upto 65. Initially it gives lesser mileage as the engine is new. It gives a mileage between 40 to 50 only, but no need to worry about that after 2 months it  will increase its mileage to above 60. Otherwise it is a good reliable bike.. Maintenance is very low.. All other spare parts are reliable.. The bad things about Splendor is the head light is very very poor. Handling & Control is Satisfactory. Coming to looks, its simple and lean we can ride very easily, it is very light weighted and it is very easy to ride in traffics, we can just bend the bike like anything in between the small gaps of other vehicles in traffic. Whereas other bikes struggle to do this.. Pick up of the engine will be poor, but it is not a matter for slow riders like me, so it is suitable for riders like me. I don’t ride the bike above 40. But the service of the service center is wrost. It is better to opt a mechanic after 2 or 3 services. I left my bike for service in HH service centres for 2 times after which the bike engine became very noisy and rough. It lost its smoothness. After that one of my cousin introduced me to a good mechanic in K K Nagar and now I am leaving bike for service there.. Now the bike is very smooth and its good to ride. Now I have completed 9000 kms and there is no issues and everything is fine.. Just service your bike with a good mechanic for every 2000 kms which costs around 700 per service, which makes your bike more reliable and smooth.. On a whole it is simple and neat bike for all middle class people. But it is good to take a well known mechanic with you at the time of buying the new bike.. Because the HH splendor engine now a days is comparatively not up to the mark like before. So if you take a good mechanic with you he can get you a good one. To all of the friends, I prefer HH Splendor. Use it safely, don’t make harsh driving so that your bike will be more reliable and you get the lower maintenance cost. Thanks"
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,"always,,,,amazing.....",5,"s an economic bike with good price. we can resale it for good price. The mileage is good. its saves the fuel. its affordable for family.

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Hero Splendor,5,"Hi guys, I have been driving this Hero Splendor a few months back and as Hardev said, this bike can beat others in its segment in terms of engine performance and mileage. The engine is super smooth and can reach up to a max speed of 90kmph making it perfect for the city rides. Further, I am very happy with the fuel efficiency of this bike as it is about 68kmpl. Since the day, I have bought this bike, fuel expenses are no more an issue. It has been four months, no issues yet.I was looking for a low-cost bike in 100 cc options which can deliver good mileage. Some of my colleagues suggested me to opt for Splendor. First I was bit skeptical as I have had heard that this bike does not feature any modern style and equipment. However, I realized then that the bike's engine is very responsive and smooth and delivers very good performance. Thus, I finally bought this and it is true to what I have heard. The mileage is superb and is abt 68kmpl."
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,"Real fuel economy bike ,Very low maintainance",4," Actually The bikes from Hero as we hear from people are worth buying because it lasts long and gives a good mileage and satisfaction to those who buy, and since mostly everyone advice to buy splendor plus since its handy and has less weight my friend bought this in 2011 ."
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,great milleage great look hero seplender+,5,"i have hero splender+,it is great bike. if you are young believe this is best bike for you if you are belongs to middle class.it has gerat look,great milleage,comfortable.you need little modification if you want to use it for street wandering.it is really awesome.newly launched colour silver is very good so if you want to buy bike and have not enough money then don't think splender+ is the best."
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,A good efficient bike.,4,We have bought this bike six months ago. It has self . It is running good . It has a powerful engine. All features are very good. The colour of the bike is also nice - it is blackish and silver colour bike. I really enjoy riding on this bike. The bike is working really good. No damage has been done yet. I would suggest this bike for a working person who uses it daily. It gives good average .The pickup of the bike is also good.But only one thing which is not good in this bike is the voice comes after we stop the bike. It is irritates sometime but it can be ignored. Service center facility of hero motorcorp is also good. They remind us the servicing date through SMS. It has 5 year warranty. They also give first 5 services free of cost. So over all a good handy bike to buy. It's price is also b/w 45000-48000.
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,about my bike splendor,4,Hero Motocorp Splendor model is one of the cheap and best models in the market. I had purchased this bike five years ago and i hv driven nearly 40000kms but know also it is in very good condition. The company said that it will give mileage near about 60kmpl but now after five years also it gives around 45-50kmpl. I have very good experience with my bike because its my favourite model and i take the bike for service regularly so that my bike remains good for long.. In terms of safety i have put onr more lock on the wheel side..And already there is one handle lock so no fear to lose my bike. My bike has alloy wheels which gives good look to my bike and for having alloy wheels there are some bebefits like if we have a lady on the back side of the bike then it prevents from any cloth come in the wheel and met an accident so alloy wheels help in that and above this all bike is of 100cc so it gives good mileage and less petrol consumption and above all my bike is perfect wid me.
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Hero ka kya kehna..!,3,"Hi , My bike splendor pro , which I bought 2 years black color is really good."
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,its 100 our 100,5,"This is the best bike in this range. I hav to travel more than 50 km  and also on the road full of pits. taking the road condition it is best bike for me....its mileage is too good....its suspension n power is absolutely fine....its acclereation power is also very good....on the whole its a comfortable bike.It has got an excellent suspension, awesome mileage, comfortable handling and ample seating space. All these features make this bike a perfect pick for the rural as well as the urban buyers. However, at the same time, I am also not happy with its below average braking system that becomes a turn down for many buyers. Well, if the company works on that, this is one of the best Hero bikes in India.ortable posture to the rider. Adhyan you said that its looks are outdated, but I would say that they are simple and sober. Infact, the exciting body graphics adds visual appeal to its looks. However, I am very dissatisfied with the braking system as it is not even the average. It has a lot of scope for improvement. Otherwise, the mileage of the bike is excellent."
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Your personal rider!!!!,5,"when it comes to ride with lot of pleasure and swag stirred in it then hero's splendor is the most obvious choice because it comes with trust of a brand which has been ruling the two wheeler market in India for about 2 decades and promises the quality ride with comfort.It's pocket friendly pricing has attracted many buyers and it's efficient engine performance and great mileage of 65-70 kmpl does not affect the owners pocket as well.I have been using it from last 4 years and i am fully satisfied with it . Hero's service support has been truly outstanding and located at almost every corner that you can possibly map out.Hero Splendor gives you the same comfortable riding experience even on the most different and difficult terrain with top speed of around 100 kmph it gives you the exact feel of flying in the air on highways/expressways .If you are looking for good bike with a decent price which comes with trust,comfort,performance and low maintenance cost  then you must go with Hero splendor to make your riding experience unforgettable.

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,About Hero Motocorp Splendor Pro Self Black Alloy,4,"With its great mileage, unparalleled performance and legendary reliability, Splender has won the trust of millions and millians of Indians. Hero Splendor Pro is the newest member in Splendor family. Hero has stuffed this bike with new features to compete with its rising competitors. This segment of bikes is the busiest segment in Indian bike market and with this bike; Hero will try to take the competition to the next levelThis bike uses the same 100c engine used in Splendor Plus but it’s been altered for improved performance. This 4-stroke, mono cylinder engine yields out a peak power output of 7.6 bhp at 7500 rpm. The torque output of this air-cooled, OHC engine is 8.04 Nm which can be achieved at 4500 rpm. Hero has equipped this bike with a four speed manual gearbox with all gears up- shift patternThe alteration made to this engine seems to be effective as this bike feels more responsive and quick than its Plus variant. It now reaches 0-60km/hr in less than 8 seconds. Its revised gear ratios are also helpful while driving in city traffic. The power and torque output of this engine is available early. This bike can reach a top speed of 85km/hr. The crispy gear ratios remove the laziness from this engine. It still can’t go pass the engines of Bajaj bikes in terms of high end performance and pick up but feels certainly better if you talk about refinement. It’s a very silent motor which bothers you least when rev hard. The early availability of torque has resulted into better throttle response and that can be easily felt when it’s in big gears at low rpms. There is very less power offered by this engine after 6000rpm and that disappoints you highways. However noise and harshness levels are very less and that gives it an advantage over others. It’s not the best engineered engine in its class but surely has the quality and potential to impress."
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,splendid splendor,4,"The bike is awesome. I have this bike from like 6 years, at that time there were no electric type.

So ig you want a bike that looks good, gives good mileage and doesn't betray in the middle of a big journey this is the bike you should choose."

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Amazing bike in affordable price.,4,"Hero splendor plus was my first bike, my father gifted me when I went to college. I always cherish those college days of riding on it which was amazing in terms of smooth and comfort rides especially in traffic conditions, as being light, it is easily managed with sharper turns in small radius.This bike have good suspension i.e. hydraulic telescopic suspension which is enough for a city road ride.Splendor plus is most selling bike of the country.why its most selling, it has many reasons behind it.First of all its look very nice which impress the customer.its look attract the customer for buying it.I bought this bike because the condition of bike is very nice. this bike is very comfortable.splendor plus has very good pick up.there are no any maintenance cost in this bike.if you are looking for a bike which average is good then go for it.

I recommend guys or even girls or aged people who r learn and can't handle heavy bikes AND people who expect best mileage AND want to handle traffic easily, can buy this bike for sure.The bike is suitable for all kinds of class starting from lower, middle and even upper class people."
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Spendor jassi koi nhi...,5,"I read some of the reviews that others have written on Hero Honda Splendour and I was shocked to learn all these features about the bike I had been riding on for the last year and a half. I started seeing stars and planets(astronomy buff u know so I like seeing special objects), well anyway I decided that I am gonna write a review on the bike that I admit not knowing much about and it is going to be a review with no technical information at all. So well the Splendour is a 4 stroke bike, with a 10.5 litres fuel tank. OOOPS sorry forgot no tech stuff(hehe kidding, I know you expected me to do some corny trick like starting of with a technical para, so I didn’t want to disappoint you). Well ok as I was saying, I have been driving my Splendour for the past year and half in Pune. Firstly, the people staying in Pune know that when I say driving its more like battling my way. Pune has one of the most congested roads where cycles, autos, buses and trucks have right of way, and they expect you to freeze in your tracks a mile before you see them. This bike has given me the kind of support you expect from a loving brother, it conveys me around the city, cures me of my boredom and whenever I feel lonely and depressed it’s always there to take me whichever place I wanted to go. Now I ask you how many bikes do you know of that will do all this. This bike gives competition to any bike that is available on the Indian market. Its cheap, its efficient to run, does not pollute like many other bikes, has very few maintenance problems and looks decent too. It has been a revolutionary bike in its own way, it was the first good looking bike brought into the Indian market(thank you Hero Honda). And in this age of FZ, Pulsar, Xtreme, this bike still holds its own with great comfort. And this is self evident if you look at the fact that even today Hero Honda’s largest selling bike is still the Splendor. What can I say, but that unless you offer me a Ducati or a Harley to own, on Indian roads, Splendor is my favorite bike to ride. So eat your hearts out you FZ and Pulsar owners. Move out of the way or I might just run you over when I’m riding (of course that could be because I’m half blind). CHOW! "
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Best Bike in this Class (100 CC),4,"Hero Splendor used to be my dream bike from my childhood and this is the first bike I brought and was never disappointed with it.  The mileage is best as far as my driving is concerned.  It gave around 55-60 kmpl.  The spares and service is a bit costly comparatively but it may be worthwhile for the result, i.e. mileage and best ride.    "
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Best Buy,4,"It has been over 5 years that I am riding a Hero Splendor and I never thought I'll be riding the same motorcycle for so long. Hero MotoCorp is simply one of the best bike manufacturers in the country that offers a durable and reliable product in such a low price. However, the bike has no advanced feature such as digital instrument cluster or tubeless tyres. Still, the quality of parts is so high that I have never felt let down by this machine. The chain does not loosen so easily but yes the battery needs a change in around 4 years. "

The engine of splendor is not good, as it sounds very much and if 2 persons will sit on byk the pickup of bike becomes so down.The old model of Splendor bike was awesome but the new one is ok ok. I think so the bike should be shine is better if u spend 5 to 10 thousand more rupees it will also give u looks.

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,I Love IT,5," Hero Splendor is one of the best bike in every era, I still remember when there was a time we use to see the ad ""are yahi to hai desh ki dhadkan” Splendor doesn’t have the target audience like Pulsar or FZ. Splendor is always available for each age group, a youngster can drive it, your father can drive it, your son can drive. Its easy to ride, very light while running & comfort zone while driving & sitting."

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Bike For Life,4,"This is my review of the Splendor Plus (April 2011 make) which is coming after I have covered 3000 Km. It is a realistic review and is not biased or favored any maker. Ride Quality: Smoothness is one of the best in its category. Engine is less noisy and ride is enjoyable. Power: A big let down, not at all satisfactory at low RPM, but gains momentum after 40 Km/h. Top speed is not being tested but engine begins to cry after 70 km/h and vibration creeps in. The bike becomes literally uncontrollable at higher speeds due to its light weight body. Mileage: It is consistently stable at 65 to 70 km/litre unless used roughly. Electrical: Again below par. The headlight is unable to spot objects at low beam. The high beam also lacks good focusing. Suspension & Tyres: The suspension system is well tuned for most of Indian roads. The tyres however need to wider for better traction during rains. Compared to others 100 cc bikes like Bajaj Platina and Discover 100 (which I have tried). Initial power and pickup of Platina is far superior to Splendor, however you will not get that smoothness in ride quality. Electrical of Discover 100 is the class bench mark. Then why splendor? Because of its reliability. I have never seen anyone complaining about it.  The spare parts are of excellent quality and the service personnel are readily available everywhere.  A very simple engine mechanism and a stable performance with almost no maintenance. Priced at around 48 K at my place it is cheaper than Bajaj and got a great resale value."
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,super milage good comfort,4,Bike has super  design and very good milage. The bike has good comfort as well as good experience to ride. It is very ideal for the beginners to learn the bike quickly and easily. Bike has light weight as well as it has good handling. The bike has less maintenance cost. The average is still 40km/h after three years of running.
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Amazing bike and really hero bike....,5,My experience with my bike is really very very smooth. As I am using this bike hero splendour plus  since last 1 year and I have totally enjoyed its rides. As talking about its working performance its really very very good and smooth and amazing. As there is no words to praise my bike. In my bikes working time I have never seems any problems during this time and I have never found it in close conditions. As far as my knowledge in any of situation and in any of conditions it never fails in it performance. And as far as my knowledge I know that in any kind of weather I have never have to face any problems in its starting. Just in only one slab or in one kick it starts within second of time. Its space and its balancing is amazing. I am really appreciate its performance as well as look of my hero splendour plus Its shape and size and weight and accessory all are really beautiful and good looking. I have even single time not fails due to its performance. Really appreciate its maker.

According to average is upto 50 km+ per per liter. Hero honda is totally controllable bike. Pickup is also good upto 60kmph, but after that it requires a little power which is ignorable. It is a family bike not a sports bike. Front single light and back red light with is good design of bike. "
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,HERO SPLENDOUR IS MY FIRST BIKE,5,"Hero splendour  is my first bike, my father gifted when I went to college.

If we are talking about mileage, it is awesome.It gives normally 50 to 60 km/lit after of 2year, depends on working condition and the number of riders. In starting it gave 80+ mileage per litre.

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,The bike of common man.,5,I have a hero motocorp spelender bike and i loved it.
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Great Bike,4,"Its a good bike which fulfill all the basic requirements of a common man.It has great average and the look is also very cool.The Hero Splendor Pro has arrived with bolder looks and the appearance of a bike that carries similar styling dynamics to the older versions of the Splendor.The new Splendor Pro is about as stylish as a bike can get for this segment. The sleek body graphics add some appeal to the bike while the front and rear face give off the same feel of a sports bike. The bike’s front cowl sports stylish graphics that enhance the bike’s sporty appeal as well.In addition to the impressive looks, the Hero Honda Splendor Pro is also a very economicalbike, an important characteristic for a bike in the Indian market.It also has 11 liters of fuel tank capacity alongwith one liter of fuel reserve.Finally, the Splendor Pro is powered by a 97.2 cc air-cooled, four-stroke single-cylinder OHC engine that produces 8 horsepower at 7,500 rpm and 8.04 Nm of torque at 4,500 rpm.Also it provides 6 services which also adds to its glimpse.Overall its an affordable bike."
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Unbeatable Hamsafar,5,"I purchased my bike on 28th July 2007, Since the purchase of this bike I never faced even a single problem. Service center had provided all 3 initial free services without any major job in the bike. And after that I put my bike on major overhaul (cluth plate, piston, bush, head etc. changes) on which there was around Rs. 9,000/- expenses. during last 8 years and more than 75000 km. Overall Its a very good experience with my HERO MOTOCORP SPLENDOR bike... This is the best in class bike.. I drives this bike in all weathers Rain, Summer, Winter but bike never says 'No'. My bike is always ready to go anywhere with me. No doubt Hero has taken the best quality components in this bike. and has done a great R&D to develop the bike. I also recommended Hero Motocorps brand to my uncle, brother & cousins and now in my family and nears, there are more than 5 bikes. I also recommend this brand to all who are reading my review. In few words I can Say ""Hero motocorps Splendor is your best friend forever""."
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,best oil mileage,4,"I got the Splendor some 6 years back. Till date it has performed quite well. Mileage is around 55-60 kmpl. Mileage could be better as petrol rates are quite high. Electric start was not there when I bought it. Wished it had electric start. The ligh...ting is also quite poor. Wished the lights were brighter. Apart from that the bike has served me well. I would probably keep it for 2 more years with me.h. Fuel capacity very very good 67 kmpl on city ride. Very comfort bike, suspension good. Look is old but no problem. Value for money.*bike with good mileage, reliable engine, very good build quality to last for atleast ten years earlier I used to have splendor now I replace it with splendor pro.It has got 11 litres of fuel tank capacity along with 1 litre of fuel reserve. Hero Honda Splendor ProSuper can give around 63-68 kmpl of mileage. The maximum fuel tank capacity is 12 litres...it looks virtually the same as before. Its beauty, if it can be called that, lies in the details and the quality. The... engine is painted a smart gunmetal grey, the overall paint finish is high on gloss and the alloys do add a sense of premium-ness to the bike. Won’t turn heads, this one, but you never bought one to do so in the first place, right?"
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Best budget bike with capability,5,"I have bought a splendor plus bike about 4months ago. I can say, its a bike with all the required features for a middle-class person. It gives a stable mileage of 58-60km per liter of petrol. And coming to the pickup I was shocked because its 100cc engine is highly energetic and can take you to heights. I use to travel in ghat roads very often and I never faced any problem with the engine pick up or performance. I like the bike very much. Hero moto corp always manufactures the bikes with utmost care. Its a brand of standards and stability. Thumbs up Hero MotoCorp!!"
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,splendor is. best bikee...better than other bikes,5,"i have two splendor bikes...one is new and second old I   love this bike and it is wonderful. Despite the millions of cosmetic updates the Splendor has been through since its inception, it looks virtually the same as before. Its beauty, if it can be called that, lies in the details and the quality. The engine is painted a smart gunmetal grey, the overall paint finish is high on gloss and the alloys do add a sense of premium-ness to the bike. Won’t turn heads, this one, but you never bought one to do so in the first place, right? I have tried both Hero Honda Bike and Hero motors bike I feel nice drive on road, nice grip, nice look and fuel consumption. What Bike For On road....great! Long drive with this bike has given me no pain to my BUTT...I  have buy this bike because its price very low and quality high. Fuel capacity very very good 67 kmpl on city ride. Very comfort bike, suspension good. Look is old but no problem. Value for money."

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,AWESOME AND TRUSTED BRAND ( INDIAN BRAND ),5,"There is no any comparison of the bike of Hero. As i have my Hero Splendor Pro bike , which is very very much better than the other brand bike. Its look , its color , its average, etc. , As i talk about my bike average its awesome , it is nearly about 65 per / ltr, which is really not only for show. So as per my experience with my hero bike i recommend my most of the friends to buy this bike. As per my knowledge the price of the bike is very reasonable so a middle section person they can also afford easily. Also if all the payment is not possible  then hero motocorp also provide a vehicle loan to buy this bike on loan by any person who wants to buy this bike. In my house we have four bikes and two moped , the all those vehicles are of hero ( Some of it buy at that time , when it is known as Hero Honda brand ) because it is a trusted brand as per our experience."
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,bull of hero,4,"Now, all I want to do is ride my bike! There are absolutely no words to describe the rush you get while riding your bike.

It is a four stroke bike, so we can use it for long purposes. Its a bike for common man who wants a good bike with all facilities and better mileage. It gives mileage of around 60-65 kmpl which is more then 90% of bikes which are in the market. It is less is weight and handling is super. And the most important part, it requires less maintenance. I have 2 brother in law along with one brother, they all use hero splender bikes. The bike i am using is 8 years old but it has capacity to sustain in todays competitive world bikes too. The tyres, suspension, engine, brakes all are of very good quality and remains safe for 8-10 year minimum if use properly. My advice to all the people who want to take bike in future is that, hero motocorp splender plus is the best bike you can get for you and your family."

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Splendor: A bike for middle class family,4,"Splendor Pro remains the same riding simplicity as its original version. Swing a leg over and you immediately feel in a controlled position. The seat is low – a boon for short riders and the overall ease of riding the bike is super good. There is no front disc option but the brakes are effective nonetheless. It is powered by the same engine as other 100cc bikes in the company’s portfolio – 97.2cc of displacement, 7.4Bhp of power and 7.95Nm of torque.The bike has Front-18 x 1.60, Alloy Wheel Type, Rear-18 x 1.60, Alloy type of wheel. The size of the  front wheel is 2.75 x 18? – 42 P / 4 PR  and that of rear wheel is 2.75 x 18? – 48P / 6 PR The ground clearance of the Hero Motocorp Splendor Pro Self Alloy is 159 mm while wheelbase is 1230 mm. The dry weight of the stylish bike is 112 kgs. Efficiency remains good at 80.60kmpl as per the IDC norms. The first gear is pretty short and best for just starting off the line. Infact, the overall ratios have been kept small for better punch during low speed ride in higher gears.The suspension set-up of the bike is simple and reliable and does the job pretty well. The bike still carries the suspension setup of front telescopic forks and hydraulic coil springs at rear, which manage to do an adequate job to provide a plush ride over broken roads as well. The minimalistic front design aides very much in handling the bike, which is very light in usage. Brakes? Drums on both the wheels, which perform their task pretty well. The Splendor Pro isn’t really a highway bike but still it is used by millions in various riding conditions and simply keeps going on and on and on!"
Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Bike that adds ur personality,4,Very impressive with performance and very impressive with looks even.. Bike that gives u least trouble and the best part is it u can use it for any purpose so people want to use for daily purpose and lil bit rough go for this bike. The engine capacity is 100cc more than sufficient if u dont want to talk with air. Symbol for safe driving even. U can easily hover to 70 with no tym and even at 80 it does not show any sign of retardness. but beyond it i mean to say at 90 100 its dangerous as u can control it in an emergency so driving within safe limit is good and 70 is not a bad speed ... More than all this.. this is one of the choices if u want to be economical the mileage ya i mean to say mileage... it is awesome beyond 70 km/ltr.. even you do not give a proper tym to tym performance. So thats the best factor its good for person in 50's and even add personality. The bike which gives u least trouble and best output with least input

Hero Splendor Plus,4.4,Excellent performance,4," bought my splendor plus special edition (having black and gold color) before two years and now odometer clocked 42500 kms, yes in 2 years, i used this much. Where ever i go, i use only bike if i go single, otherwise i use my car. I rarely use bus. That’s why, my splendor, in two years, clocked 42.5k kms. I am a heavy user, day and night time. I am going to tell about pros and corns in detail this may be useful for the buyers. About my splendor +: model 2010, only kick start, no pass button included at that time. Pros: Engine: good engine performance, i maintain speed of 50-60, never let me down on the road in day and night times. No problem till now, only servicing and changing oil One day i started my splendor and i needed to travel almost 40 kms to reach my town. That was a night time. I started and after some kms, heavy rain started, and water was flowing road-full. So i couldn’t notice pot-holes. And where ever i passed the road with full of water i maintain speed of 40 so water splashed upto my hip and whole bike almost sank in the flood of water. This happened 4-5 times before reaching my destination. But the wonderful thing is that my splendor didn’t let me down. Even 3-4 cars broke down and was standing in the midway. I was surprised. Speed: i maintain 50-60km/hr in high way Fuel: average 69km in high way Starting prob: no, even in rainy seasons Cons: Headlight: I use my bike in the night and mid night also for some 150kms at times, so the very poor part is the headlight vision. Rajeev_vermacially when a 4 wheeler from opposite direction really make me full blind. This is very dangerous, not only 4 wheelers but some two wheelers like tvs, and bajaj also make me blind with its powerful headlights. -- Hero should focus on this part. As this is very important, nowadays many companies have come with headlight modification. Even in idle mode, headlight should provide a powerful beam on the road. Handling: Handling is not upto the mark. Rajeev_vermacially in turns, if you apply sudden brake in the straight road or in the turns, the tyre will skid even in clean tar roads, and tyre grip should be taken into consideration by hero for good road grip and handling. My special fittings: Headlight: Since i use my bike in the night times, i made some alterations in the headlight portion. I use 55/60w philips after making alterations in the alternator-coil. So now the headlight is very powerful, even cars, buses, lorries use low beam when my bike is coming in the opposite direction. Mobile charger: i have fitted a multi-pin plug mobile charger, that works fine."

I hardly even change its oil for months or even service it. It's engines hardly ever breaks down and the mileage is around 80kmpl/hour. The service parts are easily available in any bike shops and tyres are also easily serviceable. This bike can go through any kind of traffic and also poth holes without damages. In winter it's a little difficult to start but you can always use the choke or try several times. The handle design is perfect for mobile holders and the rod at back of the seat is perfect for helmet locks. If you are delivery boy or office personal who needs to use GPS and lock helmet frequently this bike is having good structure and compatibility with latest mobile holders and helmet locks. You can also add anti fuel thieft lock below the fuel tank or add extra horns and usb connectionn with the battery for charging mobile. The fuel tank height is perfect for comfortable riding and you can add a leather puch to hold documents like bike puc and papers in it. The only drawback of owning this bike is it's a bad choice for intercity travel. Otherwise inside city use it's good. Perfect bike for Engineering students who want to save a lot of pocket money in repairs as it hardly needs maintenance compared to new generation bikes.

Hero XPulse 200 4V,4.3,Is Xpulse perfect for You?,4,"Xpulse is a great deal from hero motors for budget riders. With low maintenance costs and high fuel efficiency, it can be a great commuter. The comfort factor is a bit low compared to it its competitors. But is still a killer deal. The suspension is a bit on the softer end which will help you to go through potholes without giving you pain in your back. Features are alright for their price point. Being a lightweight vehicle it's easy to handle. The seating height of 820cm is a bit too high so I won't recommend it for short riders. It would be better if you atleast have a  height of 5'7 ft. The main factor of this bike is its cost-effectiveness. If you want a more premium bike with better output u can go for Suzuki's V Storm 250. Although the price is a bit too high for budget riders."

Seating position gives amazing control over the bike and tires and breaking gives you the confidence to rev the throttle. Especially ABS, mileage after 1st service I have checked on mileage in city riding and have got 235 km with 6.47 liters around 37kmpl this is calculated from reserve to reserve checked twice and the same result in city condition. Mostly single driven with an average speed of 40-50kmph. Power could have been a little better but when compared to the amount that is priced I would say any time better than any 150cc bikes which are available at the same price. Pros, the best features like abs, looks, control, slight aggressive riding position, mileage compared to its power. Pricing It can be said as of the next version of Karizma, whoever liked Karizma would love this. Maintenance is cheaper than any other 150-200 c bikes. Cons only red color looks good, other color patterns do not comprehend the bike. The gear system could have made better. Gear liver slips and can not retain back to top gear once you slow down. Overall its a worth buy for the price it is available for."

Honda XBlade,4.1,Beautiful Bike,4,It's an amazing bike with a comfortable seat. Its mileage is superb and the front look is beautiful.
Honda XBlade,4.1,Disadvantage Of The Bike,4,"First thing lightings are worst. When it comes to the highway or one way while yellow light bikes opposite vehicle's passes, mean our white lights won't be visible. I feel halogen lights are better for this XBlade instead of LED lights. 2nd disadvantage is seat cushions are like a wood plate. Body full of fibre easy to break and fade. On potholed roads, we can get each body part's vibration. Front tyres are very thin like Splendor bikes so braking is worst. The next thing side stand is not sufficient to carry 140kgs of bike weight. Plastic button locks one lock is broken means need to change that whole part. The button locks will expand the gaps of each body's fitments. Metal body means we can have the same fitment gaps till the end of bike life. Plastic moulded fibre tank. The fork is very weak and thinner like the Splendor bike. "
Honda XBlade,4.1,Worth Buying,4,"My x-blade bs6 double-disc deluxe (black color) have just completed 3,001 km . I ride through highway town as well as village non metal roads absolutely on regular basis. Till date I didn't face any trouble by any means.

Worth buying."
Honda XBlade,4.1,Excellent Bike,4,"A great bike for everything, comfort, mileage, looks, and more. A nice silent start is a very nice thing that I personally like. Honda serves us very well. Pick-up is great. Also, the full digital meter it gives you looks nice and the live averaging is the best I've ever seen. My personal advice is to buy this."
Honda XBlade,4.1,Bike Is Overall A Budget Performer,4,The bike is overall a budget fit and performance equipped in its category and stands fit in competition. A little improvement needs in aesthetics as the headlamp appears a little bit elongated which does not look bad. The rest of the things are fine. Japanese engine is best in its peak performance.

For a Solo riding experience, this one offers an awesome experience due to its specially made seat. I won't say the same about the pillion seat though. The mileage returns on the bike look pleasing enough for a 350cc category and compared to the competition, it is far better. As Honda has already specified, the looks are targeted toward the younger audience, and yeah, the whole bike gets me excited the moment I see it. It has a powerful engine and is really great in its mid-range though it lacks a bit of torque compared to the rivals like the Royal Enfields. Its slightly aggressive stance also makes the bike engaging enough that you would never really get bored of it. If there is a drawback to this machine, it's got to be how dirty it gets. And not to be exaggerating, but this is a seriously bad drawback unless you decide to add some aftermarket fenders or huggers. Other than that, every other aspect of this machine is just so eco-friendly and well, this is a Honda. So, I would definitely recommend this machine to anyone who wants a nice and engaging but relaxed ride on our Indian pothole-ridden roads. "

Honda Shine,4,Poor Bike,1,Honda CB shine liya aur ghar chala gya fir agle din 30/6/2020 barish ke karn me ghar par hi tha. Fir agle din 1/7/2020 ko me gaadi le kar nikla ghar se aur meri new Honda CB Shine gaadi problem karni chaalu ho gayi meri gaadi me 2 prakar ki samasya hai. Handel se bahot aawaj aur gayer ka bar bar fashna mene gaadi (grand Honda lodhi para chaok pandri Raipur) se kharidi hai  mene showroom se baat ki to meri problem sunne ko koyi bhi raazi nahi hai  ulta mujhe dhamki de rahe hai ki gaadi bhi rakh lenge. Aur mera payment bhi nahi denge ab me kya karu kaam me aane jaane ko mayne.
Honda Shine,4,Awesome Experience With This Bike,3,"The main problem with this bike is its gearbox. Gear ratios are not well fixed and will have to downshift to pull it in high gear low-speed scenarios in order to get a quick overtake. Acceleration is good in 0 to 55 or so looses out power past this and the engine is stressed. Engin is refined though it vibrates past 60 km but still better than any other commuter in this segment. I touched 100 km on this bike. Suspensions are well set and its quite comfortable with an average-sized co-rider but the heavier load on the bike will surely. Fuel efficiency is good if sensibly ridden. A headlamp is dull and really doesn't help very much at night. I installed fog lamps separately. Riding dynamic is good. Comfortable seat adds up to riding comfort for day to day commute or long rides. Overall if you are basically a commuter and still enjoy a little push on your daily commute, go for it without a doubt."

The experience was great. but after the sale was not well because in 2 months there was a problem with the fuel injector and the dealership had to change the fuel injector but now it's good. I bought the matte grey color which I felt the best. The riding experience is very smooth no vibration feels till 70km/hr after 70 km/hr it feels like some body roll. The top speed I achieved is 95km/hr. Sometimes it feels less power but I can be compromised with the great fuel average. The cons I feel are the missing features like a digital speedometer and fuel indicator. The pros are great average, back fuel lid. The maintenance cost is very affordable after the 10000km service the bill was 2000 to 3000 only which I think is good. "

Honda Activa 6G,4.3,"Best scooter.,",5,My first experience with Honda Activa was in 2006 and it was a very special day for our family when you came to our pavilion you just made our life with bright and luck.  it was like a soft cushion with light-weight and heavy controlling hands.
Honda Activa 6G,4.3,Great scooter.,5,"I know that the price of Activa 6G will increase due to BS6, but I hope it will not be above 10k. I have been wanting to buy a new scooter for a while now but thought I would wait for the new BS6 Activa. The new fuel injected system should give it a smoother throttle response. I hope Honda adds some new features that will justify the price increase, some new color options will be good too. What will add the cherry on the cake is if they add disc brake at the front. "
Honda Activa 6G,4.3,Nice Scooter.,5,"The Activa has always been one of the best scooters around, the only issue is that it was not youth-friendly. Meaning that it feels like a scooter for the older generation. I hope with the new 6G (or whatever they call it), they will add something that will appeal to the youth more. Maybe some new graphics or paintwork would do the trick. I know Honda already has the Dio which is kind of youth-oriented but it is very uncomfortable to ride. Let's hope for some good upgrades with the new Activa 6G."
Honda Activa 6G,4.3,Improved Safety featured bike.,5,"There has been a lot of speculation about the new Activa 6G, we all know that it will be BS6 ready.

This will be a great addition and will make a great scooter even better. "
Honda Activa 6G,4.3,Best Scooter.,5,"We have always had Activas in our family for over a decade now. It always seems to be the 'go-to' scooter for everyone. One big change in the new one that is coming is that it will be fuel-injected. This should hopefully make Activa 6G more fuel-efficient, I hope! if not then at least it will be smoother to drive thanks to the new fueling system. The slightly more complex engine might increase repairs costs if something goes wrong. But I doubt that will happen, considering how reliable the Activa has proven to be."
Honda Activa 6G,4.3,The new masterpiece by Honda.,5,"The scooter world has been dominated by the Activa for years now and I fell  Honda has started to become lazy and let the success get to them. I hope with the new Activa 6G, they will add some new segment-first features to make the product even more compelling. I love Honda scooters, their engines are extremely refined and fuel-efficient but they need to add some features to compete with their rivals. I hope the new BS6 variant will see something different that will wow the consumers."

Honda CB300R,4.3,Honda will rule now!,5,Looking damn fantastic to own & ride!
Honda CB300R,4.3,Definitely not for India,2,"I have taken a test drive of this bike with a pillion as well as a pillion on typical Bangalore roads & had been waiting for this bike for a year to be launched in India. was inclined towards it because KTMs are now too abundant in India. Below is my opinion Engine is very cool and calm.  Definitely not as harsh as a KTM.  2 Excellent build quality everything looks premium. 3 very comfortable riding position and agile for solo riding.  I am 5'11"" & felt so comfortable while riding & very bad ground clearance. The softer suspension has also to be blamed here. 2 Pillion will have a hard time holding on for his life. forget about women, even men will have a hard time. Thanks to the tiny pillion seat. Though it looks big enough in pictures, the rider will occupy more than half of the place and pillion ends up sitting in the air. Grab rails provided are useless.  Due to the light weight of the machine, with a pillion rider, the front part becomes so weightless 4. Despite the price, the bike looks tiny and doesn't have the expected road presence.  Being called a premium naked Street bike doesn't just feel right for this machine. I've seen people canceling their bookings after test riding it. Everything else is good."

KTM 200 Duke,4.4,The middle class boy's dream,5,"what do you understand by Bike? a machine? a median of fun? a companion? well everyone has a different meaning for themselves. mine was a ""Dream"". i still remember i went to bajaj showroom when i was a kid and i saw this funky orange bike with broad tyre and a digital meter, i was amazed. through i was kid i didn't knew much about bikes, engines and no one dreams small. i knew that i am here at the bajaj showroom to get my dad's discover 125 which was financed by my mom and offcourse the ktm looks expensive and here at the moment it became my childhood dream. so after many years of when i was in 11th class my friend kabir whom i recently met at a function let me rode his ktm, well at that moment i have already took the test ride from ktm but this was the first time when i checked the potential of baby duke. i decided that no matter what i have to do i want a ktm. i talked to my mom as she handles 80% of my house finances so i asked her that i want a bike , a ktm and as i expected my mom said no because we couldn't afford it but after so many days of my requests and sadness . my mom told me that now its your 12th if you clear the JEE mains with good marks i'll get you whatever bike you want. whatever and then the real journey began i worked hard been through tough times, cried, been depressed, been lonely, but cleared the jee mains. my mom didn't really expected this and here it was the moment i went to the showroom after 8 years of the day when i saw the bike for the first time, t was the time for me to take it home via finance and yes its been said that "" sabr ka fal meetha hota hai"" and thats what happended with me i got a special edition ktm duke which is green and kinda tribute to vaughin gittin jr, who is a drift racer. so i bought my bbike in year 2016 and yes it was special edition just from showroom meanwhile it got fifferent decals and the fun thing was that my bike was bs4 in 2016. yes really at that time people use to honk at me to turn off the light as it was not the rule that time and my bike didn't have a light on/off switch. so its been 2.5 years since i with my ""war machine"" yes it her name. done more than 25,000 km. travelled in rain, cold,freezing cold, storm, sandstorm, mountain ranges, swamps. comming to a proper review it had given me a highest mileage of 49 kmpl and least of 12 kmpl and the current number varies from 28-33 kmpl though it varies with individuals riding style. highest achieved speed 139 kmph as it has a torque limiter. the maintenance was less in the first year it was like 700 for a year and the second year it was 10,000-12,000rs a year. the thing i like the most about my bike is its acceleration and its heigh sitting posture, perfect for city traffic and rage. its a mad machine for stunts as well being a stunter myself i can say that from popping a wheelie in the middle of the road  to stoppies at the signal. it never let me down. you are confident around the corners you have a great low end and mid end. some of you may not believe this but i have even shown my tail light to a cbr 650f in a traffic race. don't race, dont be a squid. i always wear a helmet but sometimes you need to shut the show-offs. """" Rider apne ""karm"" se bano, bike se nahi.""""  so the downside of my ktm is sometimes it dont give mileage i complain about it secondly it could have more top speed but you could bargain it with the savage pick-up for a 200cc. though time is changing many people around me have a ktm and they dont respect it, they bought it because they can and they only bought it for getting girls behind the back read. ""RC"" for being more specific has already replaced R15 as ""laundi baaz"" bike and anyone has it and they ride it like maniacs without helmets and the common snake style riding. if you know what i mean. i want end this with respect your bike, respect what you have ! love what you like, not what others. be happy with your bike, buy a bike for yourself not for others or your girl friend, always wear a helmet, keep your bike updated, dont go harsh on throttle unless you have a emergency, open road or you are riding in sleep hours. make your bike your best friend and it will return all the love you give."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,KTM Things,4,I just love riding on this bike. I just love its sound. Whenever i go for a long drive. And its even fast. I ride whole day and night. And its mileage is like cherry on top. In love with this bike. Gear shifting and all r soo easy to do. And moreover its looks are amazin and super sexy
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Butter like smooth,5,Buttery smooth bike. Easy and fun to ride. Gear shifts are so easy. I easily do wheely with it. Love to go on races with this bike. Its fast even and the sound of the bike gives pleasure to my ears. Just in love with the bike. Its awesome
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,"Fun to ride, Expensive",4,"I bought a ktm duke 200, black on 18th sept 2016 and since then i rode it almost everyday, at the time of buying there was no other bike in my mind that was such awesome (dominar wasn't launched back then), so finally bought it. Talking about the pros of the bike, acceleration is something in which still no bike beats me in the 200 cc segment but that is self explanatory coming to mileage it is a heavy drinker i.e for me my bike gives approx 25 and even worse in bangalore traffic, and if talked about the service, ktm provides Worst Service Experience one manufacturer can provide, when i was buying there were literally fewer options, but now i guess its a stupidity if one opts for ktm duke 200."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Duke 200 review,5,This is the best 200 cc bike in India.Its power and quality is the best you can find in any bike .The riding posture is also good and does not cause pain during Long rides.The only problem might be the lack of dual channel abs but as you gain control of the bike it’s not much of a problem.
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Best one in sports bikes.,5,The bike is perfect for college going boys. Even though it is having an old design it is still best and even more attractive than the new duke 250.Still more powerful than 250 cc bikes in Yamaha.If you want a premium sports bike you can choose Yamaha FZ25 which is even more cheaper.But if you need a faster bike you can choose between the PULSAR NS200 and KTM DUKE200
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,KTM Duke 200 - The Street Butcher!!!,4,"Hi All, this is my first review of a bike.

And I am here to share my reviews about KTM Duke so, that it might be helpful for anyone. According to me “If you want to dominate the road then Duke is the perfect Monster. The sporty look and beautiful design, which is fully packed with world class features. The bike is featured with 200cc best in class engine which generates amazing torque and power. This lightweight bike gives you pleasure while riding. These are the reasons why buyer especially youngsters get attracted toward it."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Very disappointing experience,1,"Buying the KTM duke 390 has been a very disappointing experience from the time I purchased it. Within a month the engine started leaking oil, and the same was rectified only after the third service. The rear mono shock oil seal was defective, causing me back trouble. the bike has severe vibration and noise from day one."

KTM 200 Duke,4.4,KTM 390 -  the beast ,4,"There isn’t much to give away the little Duke’s low price or Indian manufacture either. The inverted WP fork and single shock deliver good ride quality and keep the chassis well under control, even at trackdays. Pirelli Diablo Rosso II tires help in all respects."

KTM 200 Duke,4.4,"KTM Duke 200 Rocks, Facts Surprisingly Shocks..!!!",4,"Good :	1) Stunning Looks 2) Mfg. Quality 3) Engine Performance 4) Ease in Handling"
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,bike,4,"i like that bike very much.because it look very nice a and it is used for sports purpose and the bike have nice features and bike have nice engine and good conditions and both front and reh have disk brake and tyre are also very good and when ever we apply brake at any need the bike will stop there only .the use of very good the main disadvantages of that bike is the mileage.if the bike give more mileage means it is very good.Riding fast means you also need brakes to match. With a 4-pot radially mounted calliper biting on the generously proportioned 300mm diameter front disc, safe precise and powerful braking is right there when you need it."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Amazing Bike With ABS,3,KTM Duke 390 is one of the best bike at 2.5 lack price tag.dis bike has really wonderful engine pickup.the speed is 140_155 at normal petrol but at extra premium petrol its speed goes to 170 top speed.ABS work perfectly.The main disadvantage is average. its give 20_30 km per litre. So its attract limited people.and heating issue disappointing very much at this price tag.
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,KTM DUKE 200,4,"The KTM Duke 200 is a light weight naked sports bike. Last year, I bought the KTM Duke 200. It is best in class and offers good mileage. Its light weight makes it easy to ride and handle as it is easily driven in any situation. The fuel tank is small. A slightly bigger fuel tank would have been appreciated. The pillion seat is not comfortable for short and long rides."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,The best bike i have ever seen,5,"The deed has finally been done, Bajaj has pulled the covers off the Duke 200 at last and let us have a go at it. For a motorcycle which was developed and built at Chakan, near Pune, it’s almost ironical that we get to see the Duke 200 last. And now that I’m done complaining about that, let’s move on to the bike itself. I can’t say I was pleasantly surprised to see how KTM the Duke looks in the flesh, I’m not just talking about the orange paint job, because like everyone else I’ve followed pictures on the web and even got to see one at the recent Tokyo Motor Show. The smashed in headlamp, the short seat, the high rear fender sitting on top of a monoshock, the upside down front forks and the tank decals – they all look fantastically aggressive."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Ktm Duke 125 Sports bike,3,The new upcoming and dynamic 
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,awesome,4,i just saw this 
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Racers DUKE,4,"The KTM Duke 200 is the first KTM to be sold in India by Bajaj . It gives 33 KM mileage ,it has stunnig Looks, Road grip is poor in KTM , Maintenance cost is slightly high, just amazing power with Maximum Power of 24.6 Bhp at 10000 rpm it will reach a Top Speed of 135 kmph and its Fuel tank capacity is 11 ltr . Looks wise its nice and the head light is been a atractive thing in the duke its breaking is nice but the back seat doesnt seems to be comfortable the back seatter always have problems while sitting there .Fuel efficiency is not so good but its easily chases pulsar 200ns. Sound of the bike is fantastic. I am a die heart fan of ktm.The strong point of this bike is its appealing looks, alloy wheels, sporty body works and its damn good stylish graphics. Its stunning looks, good breaking system and multi info display are the strong points of this bike.This bike is not good on Indian roads. Handle and control is not as per expectations, and  it heat up early n my legs starts burning."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,The Ultimate Bike !!!!,5,"Guys, If you are dreaming to buy your dream bike, then this would be the bike you would be looking for. It's cost is around 1.7L  & I'm pretty sure that it's not that affordable compared to other bikes. But I wanna tell you that this is an amazing bike you would have ever seen.It's  Light weight and easy to maneuver in city traffic. We can find High quality components fitted in the bike. It has Good brakes with linear operation. While any stuff has it's own con's such as Short gear ratio, Rear end looks quite ugly & small pillion seat which is not so comfortable. The bike has a riding posture that is upright with the foot pegs placed slightly towards the rear.  The Mileage is around 30 Kmpl which is pretty low. The Acceleration is top notch as compared to other bikes. But If you are looking for a bike which you can take it over anywhere, then it is this bike you are looking for. Final suggestion from my side is you can buy this bike for sure after seeing all the specs & comparing it with other bikes."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,bike,5,"The 390 Duke breathes life into values that have made motorcycling so amazing for decades. It combines maximum riding pleasure with optimum user value and is superior everywhere where really nimble handling counts. Light as a feather, powerful and packed with state-of-the-art technology, it guarantees undreamed of dynamic fun, whether you're in the urban jungle or a forest of bends. 390 Duke– nowhere you will find more motorcycle per euro."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,bike,5,"It rides even faster than it looks. The KTM 200 Duke is the only 200cc naked bike with real racing genes. High-tech components, such as the ultra-compact, water-cooled, single-cylinder, four-stroke engine developing 19 kW (26 hp), the compact three-chamber silencer, the ultralight tubular space frame, the state-of-the-art injection electronics, the 43 mm upside-down fork from WP Suspension and the elegant swingarm all combine to ensure maximum riding fun, powerful drive and dynamic cornering. The Duke is unbeatable with its sensational power-to-weight ratio coming from an ultra low dry weight of 129.5 kg."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Mind Blowing Bike,5,"This is the motorcycle that redefined the word 'motorcycling' in India. Never before, the Indian roads had felt Metzelers so often sailing over them. The upside down forks, ABS, reaching the 60 kmph mark in less than 2.7 seconds; and 100 under 5.6, an unbelievable but true top speed of over 170 kmph are some of the things that only rich could expect from their imported motorcycles."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Good one,3,"Ktm bike s awesome bike, but the service in Coimbatore India  is so dreadful Don buy ktm b ike in India Coimbatore,although you buy ktm bike Don even think about that service will make our bike good.they making the bike useless by their service Don buy ktm in Coimbatore Don buy ktm in Coimbatore pls Don buy ktm in CoimbatoreDuke steps ahead than any other bike .It rules the road.... i Love it....who are planning to get duke 200 just proceed dnt think of any other bike because any other bike can replace it for sure .. my top speed in duke 200 is 148.....its an very good street fighter bike just be the head in the road and be a hero ................it is very youthful and stylish bike in whatever i sawn. so don't miss the bike. "
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Grand look with no complaints,5,"The major thing of KTM their engines were mind blowing till date. Even there is no minor complaints on the model. Apt pickup and appearance is just admirable. Good bike to go for a long drive. For me it's giving 19km/ltr. Good bike to choose on going with Fz, Gixxer, Pulsar and all."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,good,5,"KTM 200 Duke is a naked motorcycle made by KTM available in Europe, Australia, Nepal, Hong Kong, India, Korea, Japan, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Colombia, Mexico and Argentina. THIS is a really good reliable and no anormous for this item i like it .and also i am purhasing this item twice  this is helpful in daily life .it engine is so strong that i bought . this item like all the people .. i sugget  to all people to purchase this vehicle really nice in ........"
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Satisfies my thirst of speed,4,"I bought this bike as I was looking for a sports bike which could dominate the streets and was able to satisfy my thirst for speed. Thus, I decided to buy the KTM Duke 200. As evident, the bike is meticulously constructed which gives it a flawless naked feel. I personally love the look of the bike as so do most of my friends. The engine is revved at 200cc which provides great thrust and throttle to the bike. You can simply feel the power as soon as you turn on the keys. My only concern is the high fuel consumption of the bike which adds to the expenses of the rider. Other than that, I am pretty contented with my ride."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,KTM reveals GHOST,5,"If you have never ridden a KTM before, chances are that you wouldn’t believe me when I say , the very definition of how much fun you can have with something between your legs is going to be shredded, I am sure people who have tasted the KTM are grinning right now,and re-living that first ride of theirs in their mind.The 390 Duke features an all-new heart with a Nikasil-coated cylinder with forged pistons and a new head crank-case, among some other new organs. This gives the single-cylinder, 373.2cc, liquid-cooled engine a healthy output of 43bhp @9500rpm and 35Nm @7500rpm, which further results in an impressive power-to-weight ratio of 296bhp per tonne. A real quick one, this."
KTM 200 Duke,4.4,Bike skits alot because of no abs ,1,Abs is must for duke 200 as its weight is also less. the tyre gets locked even at the speed of 20-30kmph .

Royal Enfield Bullet 350,4.5,The King’s ride,5,"I am riding bullet Electra since 2014. It has got reliability issues but it’s because of the poor service of RE. Like all other brands they are just into money-making and I also doubt about the knowledge and skills of their mechanics. The best solution is to look out for bullet specialists (yes these guys exist) in your neighborhood. These guys are literally doctors of the bullet. And if you ask them, they will also teach you basic troubleshooting and repair for your bull. I did my first servicing at an authorized service center and then I never visited them. It's not that I had a bad experience but I got a gut feeling that these guys are simply not competent to repair a bullet. Its also because they have loads and loads of customers. So obviously the quality of service goes down. So I took advice from a few elders who own an old bullet and I got a very good doctor for my bull. So my advice to those who are hating RE or their bike is to find a very good bullet specialist. "

The silhouette of the Continental GT is akin to that of a typical café racer and the design of the new offering from the stables of Royal Enfield has been heavily based from the 1965 Continental GT, which was a 250cc bike developed to target the young riders of that era. "

Royal Enfield Bullet 350,4.5,"Built Like a Gun, Goes Like a Bullet ! ",5,"It was my dream to own a bullet from my childhood. At last I bought a standard 350 1 years before. Since then I am a member of bullet club called Bullethood in sikar. We usually go for long rides. The bike is an absolute joy to ride. At speeds of 40 KMPH where the fibre bodied ones begin to rattle, the Bullet stays firm. Of course its no match to the racing bikes but none of those can match the pleasure you get from riding a Bullet. The other RE models look good too but none, absolutely none can match the vintage feel of the Standard 350. My bike is delivering very good power, comfort & feel of riding. I am pretty much satisfied with my bike. But still there are some drawbacks for the bike. They are : "
Royal Enfield Bullet 350,4.5,A POWERFUL BIKE,4,"This is an awesome bike available at the price of 1,47,400. The bike is available in 3 colours. I bought the royal maroon option. The bike has self start facility but no digital speedometer or fuel gauge. The speedometer is analogue. The bike gives a mileage of around 33 kilometer per liter on a normal traffic road. The fuel tank capacity is about 12 litres (approx).Hence for long journeys there is no need for time to time fulfilling the tank. It is a 346 cc bike with a maximum power of 19 bhp. The bike has 5 gears and comes with front disc brake facility.  The bike is suited for healthy persons as the bike is about of 182 kg. The staff of the shop from where i have bought this vehicle told me such. The bike achieves a speed of 0 to 50 in 5 seconds.and  the vehicle has a speed of  130 kilometer per hour. The head light has halogen bulb type. The bike has a comfortable seat. The vehicle adds a flavour to your personality. I had a great experience with this bike. I was caught once by the police due to not wearing helmet and paid more then the usual fine due to this bike because the person bearing this is understood to be rich. The bike has boxes for keeping tools and bike's papers. If you are planning to buy this bike don't think much and buy it for the bike is awesome."

My one is showing a great mileage of 45km/liter to 47km/liter in city conditions. Servicing cost is also not much. If you are thinking about it then just go for it.

Royal Enfield Bullet 350,4.5,Let your senses decide.,4,"From my personal experience so far, here's what I think: · Performance of the bike does not depend just on the new unit constructed engine, but also on the usage. If ridden within acceptable limits, the bike will exhibit a higher than perceived fuel efficiency. I get raised eyebrows from people when they hear my bike runs at 40–42 kmpl.· Although the bike is sufficiently engineered to serve both everyday commute and long rides, it is still not a perfect machine. There may be minor sporadic issues like blown lighting bulbs(parking, speedo) , braking switches going kaput, clutch cable snapping and some more. So far, I have not experienced any serious breakdown, while on the road. Bottom line is, if the vehicle gets its due attention and servicing, chances are rather slim that one would face issues.· Like many RE bikes, it does not have tubeless tyres, which obviously means, that a puncture on the road will certainly cause some distress. But then, if you ride with the correct tyre pressure, you may not have to see that day.· As mentioned earlier, one can do long stretches on it, and it is quite comfortable. Credits to the spring seat for that. For the pillion rider though, I cannot say the same. The stock pillion seat and a lack of backrests, are to blame. In one of my rides along with a friend who rode pillion, after 9 hours of riding, he utterly refused to ride back in the same fashion and took the overnight bus instead. May be, RE should think about the pillion rider too, and include a better pillion seat and a decent backrest.· Though it lacks features like a tachometer, a fuel gauge, which some consider standard in today's bikes, I personally did not feel the need. Absence of a fuel gauge will require you to do some math, and also be aware of fuel amount left. I am not sure if a tachometer will help in anything else, other than giving a clue on when to switch gears. If you intend to own one, then you must ride it once, get the feel of it, and let your senses to decide."
Royal Enfield Bullet 350,4.5,Nice economic bike,3,Everything of Royal Enfield Bullet 350 is good but the backside along with the number plate of these models is slightly bending either right or left.

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,my worst decission  for purchasing this bike.,1,If any one want to purchase this bike then please dont go for it. I have purchased this bike on 23 aprill 2018 and today bike silencer is getting rust . Even the showroom owner and their worker were not having any sence that how to talk with a customer . The parts of bike very weak as if when i am riding a bike then it looks as fuel tank will be damaged. Over all i am not happy at all from this bike. So guys think twice before purchasing apache 160 4v . Once money has been invested then you will be in loss and company will be in profit.
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,New King of the segment,4,Have owned the new Apache 160 4v carb with rear disc for the past 1 month. 
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Daily Commuter Stay Away it has Worst Mileage | 35 KMPL,3,Hello 
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Awesome bike,4,I am very happy with this bike ...but not happy with TVS finance team and ofcourse rate of interest...The guy who is setting in the dealer shop denied to give RC he said when your first EMI deduct than they will provide the RC..After long discussion and arguements they handover to me ...
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Bike is good...but wrost service from all dealer's,2,In Showroom they say like mileage will be 45 but its not giving atleast 40..its only giving 35. .
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Best bike in 160 cc segment,5,"To begin with this bike is the most smooth bike in 160 segment. Have been riding this beauty for approx. 1 month, and believe me this bike is the best of all the bikes that I have ridden so far. Vibrations are almost nil, mileage is superb for 160 segment. "
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,The wonderful and powerful creation from the team TVS,5,Every biker has the dream for his bike likewise me also. I purchased this bike an year bike and it has an excellent road grip and powerful engine with good mileage. 
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,200 4v is better choice,3,It is all about looks. I have not ridden any 160cc bike before but I feel that it's power is quite average . It dose not provide the grunt need to overtake . Its power band is also very high above 8000 rpm so bike has a liner pickup . It is made for strait line cruising but not for city use . Turning radius is also small. My bike also has a issue that if the bike is in rest for 20 min then it do not fire up with self or by kick it takes 5 to 6 attempt to get started which is quit shamefully. It has very less milage of 35 kmpl if ridden in city. Considering its milage and performance I prefer 200 4v. Abs should be as an option. Rear disk is small.
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Best Bike In 150 Segment ,4,"Nearly 1year 5months I am the owner of TVS Apache RTR 160 stylish bike. It gives a mileage of 45-47kmpl and top speed is 127kph & best in class throttle response and easy to handle in short turns, it has a top speed marker. "
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,milage r so less ????,4,this is good for race in highway and also traffic u easily chase any four wheelers but I ride this Apache 160 over 10000km and I found two problems on it 
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Best bike. ,5,Best bike  in 150cc segment.  great mileage of 45-50kmpl. great handling even in off road conditions. 
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Beauty and the beast!!!,4,I purchased this bike in March 2017 for 83k and have been using for daily commute to office which is 30kms both ways. The looks as you can see is great in this range. The pickup is great as it's a 160cc bike and apache are racing bikes. So this is taken care of. The mileage however is 42kmpl that too when most of my travel is on highways. Its a sure eye Turner. The dragon eye headlights look cool. The balance of the bike is very good (I am actually surprised). But at the same time the handling is a bit clumsy specially while parking or in heavy traffic.
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Fabulous bike in 160 cc,5,i got a new bike rtr 160 five months ago. I love this bike its give me super millage of 53kmpl. I have this bike because it's breaking is superb it got 0-60 in just 3 secondu200B . that's why i love it's pickup. it's superb bike i prefer this bike to buy????

When comparing the apache rtr 180, pulsar180 and fz the apache rtr is the best but some of other factors are not so much good like it is slipping in wet roads and its body sound like that but handling, power and look is owesome.   I think if we are going to select a 180cc monster it is good to select the racing dna apache rtr 180,i bought a new apache rtr 180 beast 1 month ago. yesterday me and my friends gone for a trip on two bikes (apache and   pulser 200 dtsi) we had done a couple of drags. Above all our predictions we really amazed. the bike really scarly fast. it touched a top speed of 109kmph. it raised above the pulsar really like a beast. superb pickup,stunning luk,42-48 mileage,extreme power and above all supreme handling. king of all 180 bikes"

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,TVS Apache Review,4,"It is a nice bike, it gives 45 mileage in city roads even it is a 160 cc segment bike, The pick up of the bike is very good, Bike is having tubeless tires for latest models,"
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,yes its scarily fast........,4, i have apache  rtr 160... my first choice is bajaj pulser but when i ride the apache ...as we all know that apache have st meter in mode of meter which measures the speed from 0  to 60 and i think other bike are far away in this pick up and power i got the speed of of 60 km per hr in just 4.7 sec ..and am try to decreasing  this time period  i have new model of apache 160 and like much more than old model this model have extra features rather then the old one..
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,The Beast,5,"Awesome performance. Superb mileage. It becomes your best companion. Pick-up matches that of Bat-Mobile. Sporty looks just uplifts the feeling of bike riding. You can't miss long rides on highway if you have TVS Apache.The bike is way too heavy for slim and shady people. Tires could have been little more thicker. Mileage is around 45 kmpl for TVS Apache RTR 160 Variant. I have completed around 20000 kilo metre ( Over a period of three and a half years ) still it runs like a maze runner. Batteries are not working though. Odometer could have been more attractive. Controls given for accessing odometer are not user friendly. On a positive side, disc brakes won't disappoint you. It stops exactly where you want.It could have been better if TVS had provided a sporty look helmet, like Yamaha does with its sports bikes. Sadly, they would not givew you any free helmets with this beast. If you are an Apache fan, there is no going back. This is a must have bike for every bike lover. Riding on highways would just uplift the biking experience you just craved for."
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Amazing bike,5," am using Apache RTR 160 since 7 years . coming to the fact rtr is more better then pulsar 200 pickup is awesome looks r simple end nice . breaking is excellent .Riding ling drives is very comfortable.if you r looking for a new bike better try this in affordable budget. its real racing bike. TVS was out of my list as I came across a lot of quality issue rumors, I repeat RUMORS about it. But thanks to my long time no see friend who had his 2 year old Apache RTR on which I had a short ride. Just one word. MIND BLOWING! Not just in terms of performance but so surprised on the price as well. I had the test ride on this monster on Diwali of 2009(I loved riding it so I wanted to ride it again), booked it on the same day, and got it delivered on the next 1 week. My first 1000kms with my bike was the hardest times I had. My right wrist was constantly cursing me for not twisting it, as so many silly craps were riding fast ahead me. But for the sake of my bike's performance and life, I had to take those curses and tame that monster within 40-45kmph."
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Good bike,5,"I Purchased TVS In Dec 12,in three years I have driven 30000km on this bike.it is running good in all these three years with an average of 40km/l on delhi roads.It broke down only once due to spark plug.but I think its service centre are expensive they love to just put all new parts in bike even if they don't needed with bills of around 3k.after free service I am servicing my bike outside and found no problem apart from brake shoe,and chainset which I have changed at 25k km.overall pickup of bike is good.i have went upto 115km/hr on this bike.rear and front tubeless tires are also good.i am running with 6 puncture in rear wheel without any problem ,just airfill up at 10 days."

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Sudden Reaction,4,the engine of the bike is very much impressive and fast and the response time of the bike is very much less which is a very good thing. The latest iteration of the RTR had its tryst with aggressive styling but the results are disputed.Handling of this bike is great especially on turns and the mileage is not great but decent.the mileage is ranging from 35 to 40 which is very much economical for me in the tricity as per the price of the petrol in city.

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Awesome,5,"i got this TVS bike year ago.it  isa few years from launching its new-generation Apache, so to keep the current crop of buyers from moving to the Pulsar 200NS, this facelift is their stop-gap measure."
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,okkkk......bike...,3,
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Tvs Apache RTR 160,5,"bike certainly looks good and modern with every bits and pieces exuding style. The front is what keeps the Apache RTR 160 stand apart from the crowd, with the LED daytime running lamps flanked at both top edges of the headlight. The side view is highlighted by a big and sharp fuel tank with excellent knee recesses, which comes adorned with 'Apache' decals written and has some racy stance to it. The rear has not much changed yet, with the same tail light unit, with an LED layout to it. Though the rear side panel carvings are new and look much better than the previous one. The instrument console has also been retained from previous generation model, with an LCD displaying speedometer, odometer, two trip meters, clock and fuel gauge, accompanied by an analog tachometer and plethora of tell tale indicators. The engine and alloy wheels are given matte black treatment and looks nice. The overall fit and finish is also good and feels solidly built.VS Apache RTR 160 is an incredible value for money at the price which it comes stickered with, as it gives such oodles of performance at a price lower than the upper end, entry level sportbikes, without being sacrificing too much on fuel efficiency and practicality. It is a pocket rocket which loves to be revved every time you sit on the saddle, which no other bike around its price bracket can, and it is this trait which sets this 160cc monster from TVS in a league of its own."

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Good n stylish bike,2,"[10/2, 7:51 PM] Saurabh Sharma: I was taken aback when Vikrant asked me to switch rides and handed over the keys of the TVS Apache RTR 180 ABS. Though it was a sudden shift but I wasn’t complaining, as I feel the Apache RTR 180 ABS is among the dark horses in its segment and I always had a soft spot for the bike. Getting back to the motorcycle, initially I used to feel that the bike was cramped for space and that the fuel tank recess was too narrow for me to grip it with my thighs. But I got used to the slightly odd riding position of the bike in the following days."
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,sports bike ,4,i like it from 10th so i buy it its great bike for off road rides great to do stunts at roads on it best for balance and speed for me top speed which i was run was 130km/hr great controll good to buy this but just for avg is some what down so for looks it is a great as avg. is just 40 km per litre only so i want to be like as a sports bike it . great experience with this tvs apache 180 so if anybody want 180cc then buy apache

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,TVS RTR160 BLACK,4,"TVS RTR 160 is  a great bike,with zero sound,smooth road grip,and can run smoothly on the road.Its features and looks show it is a sports bike.Since it is a 160 cc bike it consumes petrol little faster,but the time it saves for me is unprecedented. I have black color bike of this model,there are various colors of it too.The looks of the bike is absolutely great,with style.It has a disc brake feature to stop at any point i desired,with great cushion springs to minimize jerking.Further it has digital meters with clock display along with date time,which helps me to check the time during driving.It has also energy meter to inform me the quantity of petrol in the tank.It also has the power start feature that helps me stop the bike during traffic jam or signals,and start the bike instantly rather than wasting time in kick start.My bike after 1 year gives 42-43 km/l which may seem less but it covers much distance in no time,and the best thing about it is when I run it at high speeds,the amount of jerking is minimal as compared to my old bike which is Hero Passion Plus,but my old bike used to give more mileage,but this one saves time for me.And you know that Time Is Money."

The Apache RTR is one of the best bikes in the 150cc-200cc segment. It is small and powerful bike that mainly attracts Indian youth. The bike is one of the best engineering product of TVS company. Its engine puts out 16 bhp of power that is best in this segment. "
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,"My Monster, The Apache RTR 180",4,"I live in Rajasthan and my name is Siddharth Rawat. I bought my RTR 180 in 2013. Yes, two years have gone by, it is still performing like a new bike. A bit of credit goes to me as well, for keeping it up to date, riding its smoothly and safely and following its timely maintenance schedule. It has got a decent mileage of 45 kmpl and have an awesome pick-up, it flies as soon as you pull the accelerator. But there are some areas of concerns with RTR 180 such as vibration at high speeds and tyres not having good grip on the road. The rear tyre is too slippery that makes the driver to ride it cautiously on wet surface. Other than this, the sporty bike runs fast and is good for both highways and in-city riding. I have taken it to a top speed of 160 kmph that never felt confident with the bike. I travel from Jaipur to Ajmer at a regular basis and I never faced any problem with the bike in long distance driving. I would always suggest you to go for RTR 180 over its competitors."

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Wonderful bike,3,"Dear friends,"
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Best motorcycle at this price,4,"After the success of Apache RTR 160, TVS came with its most popular bike having a 180cc engine. The bike looked slightly different from its siblings but carry the Apache sporty looks. The headlight and taillight are shaped differently from the previous model enhancing the designing of the motorcycle. The engine is very powerful but there is a bit of power lag before 3000 rpm but as soon as the bike crosses the 3000 rpm mark, there is nothing better than it. I felt that its gear shifting is rough but my friends and brother found it absolutely perfect. Its sound is great and being a sports bike, it balances well and is not problematic at sharp turns. As far as its price is concerned, it is the only option in the Indian two-wheeler market with so much power at such a reasonable price. Its mileage is also the best if compared to other bikes in its segment. Its biggest rival is FZ."
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Road Monster,4,Hello friends!!!
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,TVS Apache,4,"Hello friends I am the Happy owner of TVS Apache. After doing lots of research on the bikes in this engine segment. I have shortlisted Bajaj Pulsar, Honda Unicorn and TVS Apache. Also evaluated the FZ16. I was searching a machine with good power and combination. I have waited long for FZ but waiting period is too long and also the mileage claimed by the company was too low in compare with TVS Apache RTR  so I decided to take the plunge with RTR."
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,TVS Apache,3,Hiii friends
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Money worth !!! Awsme bike ! Loving it.,3," bought this bike around 20 days ago. First servicing is not done yet. Following are the reviews which I have felt: Pros: 1.Great performance. 2.High pickup(as suggested by Apache 0-60 in 4.5 sec.). Can easily beat Pulsar 150, Yamaha FZ series, Yamaha R15 in the long run. 3.Riding quality is good.Feels like driving a racing car. 4.Great looks and stunning graphics. 5.Most significant is its new daylight(like Audi) addition in hyper-edge new model. 6.Most powerful headlight in its class. 7.Front roto petal disc is good. 8.Reserve fuel capacity is 2.6 ltr. 9.Head is not too heavy like pulsar. Handling in city around corners is fine. Cons: 1.Gear shifting problem. Though service center guys assured me no problem would be there after first servicing. 2.For older guys little back pain might occur due to its riding posture. 3.Resale value is less.But in my opinion go with your choice. If you like, buy this bike.Once in a lifetime experience. Overall review, this bike is worth buying. Can easily compete Yamaha, Hero, Pulsar in overall performance."

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Best bike in Tvs Brand,5,"TVS Apache RTR 180 has essentially remained unchanged since its launch – barring the styling of course which was only recently upgraded – the bike still remains relevant. For the same price as the Suzuki Gixxer one gets a larger, more powerful engine; a more up-to-date braking system; and a bike that’s proper fun to ride. "

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Nice bike speed boost to much,3,"I have purchased it on 26-sep-2014. The bike is really good but there are some features missing from it like auto side light off, side stand light. The mileage of bike is enough it is giving me 41 kmpl now but in starting it was giving 50. Service center in my area is really poor (Kankria,Ahmedabad). Speed of bike is good you will love it when it is on the top. I think front wheel of my bike is not proper because when I start riding it I can clearly feel the wheel is tortuous. The bike is not much comfortable as comparing to pulsar 150. It lightweight than pulsar 150. Because of its lightweight you will love to ride it but when truck, car or bus will pass near by you the bike will unstable. The spedometer is too much hard it is very disapointing I cant set anything in it. The company should take care of customers I am not satisfied with the bike."

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,A beast ,4,I bought this awesome bike for a temporary becoz I loved R15 and plan to switch to R15. But after couple of days I realized this is the best in city traffic and some point in highway and for long ride.

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Monster in my hand,5,"I am just feeling thrilled while writing this review. One of the finest and best performance bike ever i have seen. The bike is really a best blend of racing DNA. The bike looks awesome with its very strong headlight , tail light, indicators and horn. The seat is quite comfortable. The bike is having a very high acceleration i.e it can attain a very high speed within less time. A very handy bike that can be easily handled though any traffic jam. The C.G is well maintained when it takes turn ruling out any kind of possibility to skid. The tyres are very good with good with and is very road gripping even when the road is wet. The engine is very smooth and the sound is really thrilling. The gear transmission is well smooth and the clutch working is really fine. Now coming to the braking system which is really very strong that helps to stop in a very short distance. The mileage is good with 40-42 km/liter. The speed indicator looks nice with its blue back light. This bike is really a trustworthy and a monster as well.  My experience is awesome. If you really wanna something special then go for it. All the best :-)"
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,My Apache 180 RTR is Awesome Bike,5,"I have purchased Apache 180 RTR in the year 2011, When it's newly Introduced this variant, But when I ride  Apache 180 RTR, Really i felt it's my second girl friend. Going to the handle awesome and design as well as 180 cc, Performance. The bike has the best power to weight ratio in its class. It performs terrific between 3000-7000 rpm,  It does 0-100km/hr within 14 seconds and goes all the way to a whacking top speed of 124km/hr. Sadly, TVS couldn't get rid of the vibrations at high speeds. This engine is surely less refined and makes a lot of noise at high rpms. There is not much storage space in this bike. However, for your safety, Apache 180 comes with a rear guard and front leg guard. The high end performance of this engine is not as impressive as Pulsar 180. Even i did race this Apache 180 RTR, what a experience, i have got from this vehicle. Till date i am using this vehicle coz i said this vehicle my best vehicle in my life.   Even i am waiting new vehicle like this. Going to mileage 42-46km/ltr. Thanks TVS for introduced such good vehicle in India."

But thanks to my long time no see friend who had his 2 year old apache rtr on which I had a short ride. Just one word. MINDBLOWING! Not just in terms of perfomance but so suprised on the price as well. I had the test ride on this monster on diwali of 2009(I loved riding it so I wanted to ride it again), booked it on the same day, and got it delivered on the next 1 week. My first 1000kms with my bike was the hardest times I had. My right wrist was constantly cursing me for not twisting it, as so many silly craps were riding fast ahead me. But for the sake of my bike's perfomance and life, I had to take those curses and tame that monster within 40-45kmph."

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,mt hero my bike,4,"I bought this bike around 20 days ago. First servicing is not done yet. Following are the reviews which I have felt: Pros: 1.Great performance. 2.High pickup(as suggested by Apache 0-60 in 4.5 sec.). Can easily beat Pulsar 150, Yamaha FZ series, Yamaha R15 in the long run. 3.Riding quality is good.Feels like driving a racing car. 4.Great looks and stunning graphics. 5.Most significant is its new daylight(like Audi) addition in hyper-edge new model. 6.Most powerful headlight in its class. 7.Front roto petal disc is good. 8.Reserve fuel capacity is 2.6 ltr. 9.Head is not too heavy like pulsar. Handling in city around corners is fine. Cons: 1.Gear shifting problem. Though service center guys assured me no problem would be there after first servicing. 2.For older guys little back pain might occur due to its riding posture. 3.Resale value is less.But in my opinion go with your choice. If you like, buy this bike.Once in a lifetime experience. Overall review, this bike is worth buying. Can easily compete Yamaha, Hero, Pulsar in overall performance..keep riding and ride safe..thanks tvs ...."

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,GOOD,4,Very pain full during long journeys of above 40 kms. My body feels stress in handlebars and
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Overall good ,4,"Bought this bike on Nov 2014,"
TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Racing DNA Unleashed,5,"The 177.4cc engine on the TVS Apache RTR 180 develops a peak output of 17.03 BHP @ 8500 RPM and 15.5 Nm @ 6500 RPM. The numbers here, though useful, do not prepare you for the sheer grunt and gruffness of the engine once you’re astride it. Sure, there are more powerful bikes than it, not just on paper but also in the real world, but nothing this side of the 250cc bracket has the same grunty roar as this. Thumb the starter and you’re welcomed with a deep throaty noise before the engine settles into its rather silent (comparatively) idling. Do not, however, assume the engine lacks refinement going just by its note. Sure, there are vibrations that creep in through the usual suspects, the handlebars and the footpegs, but the oversquare engine is rather eager to build revs and with it, the refinement rather improves.0 – 60 comes up in 4.7 seconds while it takes 10.8 seconds 0 -100 kmph, from there it goes on to a speedo indicated top speed of 126 kmph.Fuel economy (mileage) of the TVS Apache RTR 180 stood at 43 kmpl in city conditions and 47 kmpl on the highway.Coming to the braking, the TVS Apache RTR 180 is shod with disc brakes both up front and at the back.The rear of the motorcycle tends to skip under hard braking, but that’s mainly due to the short wheel base and better rubber should help reduce that and grip better. The front hardly dives in much and it is quite possible to brake late into a corner and get away with it.The TVS Apache RTR 180 ABS has proven itself a worthy contender for my attention and consideration. Sure there are slight drawbacks, such as ergonomics for the generously proportioned or the vibes, but the positives i see in this motorcycle from TVS would rather have me oversee them. It rides well, handles confidently, is quite efficient and has a feel that most riders can connect with. Not to forget, its got your back under tricky conditions with that ABS and you don’t need a better reason than this to get yourself one."

It has a cool sporty look with LED lights which gives a fab look to the bike. If we compare Apache 160 RTR (Hyper Edge) with  Hero CBZ Extreme than Its possible that Apache will beat CBZ on the road.

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V,4.4,Not race machine it's Noise machine,1,"Worst bike.I brought this bike on october 2nd. I faced these problems1.Strange noise from silencerFrom the second day onwards strange noise is coming from silence (toop,toop...) i immediately took bike to show room guys they did something, then sound stooped for a day or so. From the next day onwards again sound started.Even after first service also i could hear noise from silencer.2.Noise from brakes without even applying(even after first service also)3.Rpm goes up and down automatically.When i starts the bike rpm looks good,after riding some kilometres rpm goes up(i.E engine runs in 4000 to 5000 rpm, even in neutral) and produces too much heat. Sometime rpm is too low causing vehicle to stop suddenly in traffic (in first gear)4.Gear shifting is not smooth.5. Poor servicing. I explained all the issues to the mechanic during first service He did nothing he just washed and applied some grease and returned it to me.6.Poor mechanics they cannot even predict the problem.They will apply some grease and oil to parts wherever the noise is coming the noise will stops for sometime but later on its starts again.Overall this is the worst bike i recommend you to go for other company then this f******* tvs"

Mileage is also decent while riding at speeds between 40-60 km/h. Performance-oriented bike with commuting facilities. Better and faster than most other 180s. But turning radius of this bike disappointed me a bit. Along with that, no gear indicator, LED headlight and thinner 110 section rear tyre in single disc brake version do not match with the class it really belongs. Hoping for better upgrades."

TVS Star City Plus,4.4,blasting tvs,3,gud bike but...
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,STARTING ISSUES,1,The bike is becoming a problem for me as it has starting issues from day 1 and once it starts (after burning my precious fuel over choke) and riding for 2-3 kms and if slows down it again goes off. The company claims 74 kmpl mileage but how can any one get that if this kind of problems persist. Its on 800kms i have got serviced once still no change the service person says its ok. The service people there also do not how to switch off the setting indicator (the service reminder indicator) i told them this is service reminder indicator please fix they said chalne do bhaiya bike toh sahi chal rahi hai abhi koi ladka delhi jayega toh seekh kar ayega tab kara lena. This wasn't acceptable. My father told me to buy a hero motorcycle but being fan of MS DHONI and relation values i bought TVS. I am very disappointed and will never suggest any one to go for TVS. My friends and co workers after driving my bike says bhai maza nhn aaya. This very like hell to me.

I usually go on speed between 50 to 60 only, but mileage went very down 35 to 40 only. The braking system started to skid. The gearbox is really poor, I can't easily access it in traffic. but star city + is great in looks and design only.  The engine gets noisy nowadays. The clutch is hard to access. Though I service it regularly and still it gives me more problems. "

The person at the TVS showroom said that the bike’s average is 86kmpl and I was like Okay but it has been a month that I have got its tank filled to the top and I have covered above 700kms. Now I think he was right and yes the fuel tank capacity is 10 liter."

TVS Star City Plus,4.4,Most Stunning Experience  With My First Bike ,4,I am Karthik and i recently graduated and got job in Guntur.So after getting my first month salary i asked my father i want to buy a bike and my father immediately told me to buy TVS bike as my father was using the same company bike from last 10 years.Ans i bought it and then the experience with this bike was so awesome .The bike design is most stunning and coming to engine it is 100cc Engine with self start mode and quite economical for the middle class people.At present it is giving around 65 kmpl and expecting more.It has been 5 months now and the performance is great and cool looking.I definitely recommend this bike for one who wants both economical point as well as looking aspects.
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,TVS Star City,4,"I bought this bike in January, 2015 and for me it is the best cost effective and stylish bike in the market with good average. However I always miss the electric start feature. I usually ride my bike for commuting between office and home and it provides great average and never leaves me helpless whenever I need it. Touch wood I really attached with it and I think it is also attached with me in same manner as I'm. I have not faced any trouble with it as of now. I have suggested this bike to two of my friends and they are also very happy with it. On the weekend we always roaming in our near by locations with our bike and it feels pleasant. Last Sunday we went to Mathura and it was a great experience as it was a first long trip for me on bike. We enjoyed a lot however my bikes Tyre got damage while coming from there. However we got assistance from the local residents and replaced with new Tyre.  It gives an average of rs.55-60/Per liter for me. It was really a pleasure to share my views about my bike here. Great!! Thanks "
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,joy ride for moving within the city,5,"I own a TVS star city plus kick start red colour bike for past 2 years. it is a 110 cc bike. I love to ride it in the city for it offers me a very good mileage of 60-65 kmpl. it has huge oil tank with reserve capacity of approx 2.5 liter which is very good and i never ran out of fuel. the design is good which makes it a very attractive bike under 50k.  it produces little noise and achieves speed very soon. I have taken it to speed of 85 kmph while once travelling on patna - gaya road. till to date, it has punctured only once though it is often used on rough roads . even my father loves this bike. he often take it on weekends for going anywhere. experience wise, it is far better than splendor, i had once taken my bike to nani-ghar in gorakhpur (300 km from my home) and the journey was great."
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,Mera batman ride,4,It is with immense pleasure i am hereby sharing my expierience of joy with mera batman bike..it is none other than my TVS STAZZ CITY..it was the 1st model came with self start..eventhough i borrowed it as a second hand i never felt it as the same..brakes are no more inferior than luxury vehicles..i will recommend it only for travelling in kaccha road..not suitable for highways because of 2 biggest disadvantages..first beyond 70kmph speed vehicle wont run further fast..its only the engine that runs..second regarding quantitative performance per litre of petrol..even after regular service good maintainance it still gives max40km per litre dat too in national highways only..one more important issue is that if you raise beyond 60 then it will virtually start flying just above the road..at that juncture if you apply brake then 200 percentt you will be surely in hospital next day..i had met an accident by doing so..but still i call it as my batman bike coz i like both..and i have an emotional bonding with my bike..and after riding this bike you will feel other higher version bikes as abnormal..overall it is not at all suitable for long ride..go for it if you are a office  worker who daily roams around city for official purpose and also for people in rural areas..for its prize it is definitely do justice..Thank you

It's salient features , its design , wheels , smoothness on road is unmatched if compared to bikes of other brand, mileage is at its best because I usually get about 60-65 km/l. The quality which you receive after paying the sum for the bike its more than the worth. As I have shared all my best days with my buddy , my star city. It's quite a coincidence that the number of Friends I suggested to buy it they bought it and now they always thank me for my advice. I feel proud to be the owner of a motorcycle which can compete with any other brands motorcycle of the same category and will be the dominating winner. It is good to have a partner where you need it. I never got stuck in any place when I am with my star city. All the features that you require in a motorcycle it has more than it. I would say that it will be with me till time."
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,"Perfect commuter bike, Great mileage",5,I had purchased TVS STAR CITY+  3 months ago. It's a great bike from TVS. It is loaded with 110cc eco thrust engine. It feels very smooth in riding this bike. Handling of bike is very easy and controllable even on  sharp turns. 
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,good,4,"I have purchased this TVS STar City +  couple of month back just for one thing that is to get maximum mielage as i have Daily run of approx 70km per day, Trust me it delivers what i expected for Star City as Tvs claims an mileage of 86 kmpl,"
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,the new star in the city,4,"first I would like to say that my first bike was TVS Victor GL purchase in 2003(on road price appx.43000). After 13 years experience experience I can say that I never experience starting trouble in hole time.due to long time I have decided to change my bike .My mind was fully make up for Honda bike when I go in market for bike first iseen Honda Shine(125CC) price was 67000 approx. on road  .After that when I come back my better half told me "" TVS bike dekhne me kya jaata hai ""  then we visit TVS store we amazed when we seen TVS Star City Plus with metallic gray color look is so nice and when I take trial again my mind changed and compare with price and requirement I have decided to purchase once again TVS and finally I purchase this bike on my both daughters birthday means 19.07.2015. After 2 month experience I can say that this is wonder bike with 55000/- on road price.following is prons. and cons."
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,great experience with right choice,5,"In a much-needed boost to it's motorcycle portfolio, TVS has launched the latest avatar from the Star bike family - Star City+. First showcased at this year's Auto Expo, the Star City+ is a refreshed and premium variant aimed to attract new young buyers who are now spoilt for choice in this continuously growing entry-level motorcycle segment."
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,best bike from tvs,4," i buy it on July 2014 @ 50,000(approx) its more than 1 year and still it working great. it is a good bike with all good features to have with it. it has a 110 cc engine which is good at this price  and also the mileage is its big plus point its easily give me a mileage of 60 km per liter. i buy the black color model. tvs star city plus has black alloy wheels which looks stylish and it has good capacity petrol tank and it has a unique feature called service indicator which blinks when bike need service.it has high grip tyres and has a good spring shock absorbers.it has good length seat and 3 persons can sit on it quit easily.it has electric start which is good at this price."
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,Excellent bike for city commuter s,4,I have purchased this bike recently and I'm fully satisfied with this bike. The pickup is very nice so that i can easily ride it in heavy traffic. As i have to ride 60-70km daily because of my job I'm feeling happy this bike is giving me superb milage. The design is ok for this price range and it is light in weight also. The riding sound is very smooth you can enjoy the rides for very longer distances. You can go upto 90 kilometers per hour speed and it won't give you any glitches but the gear changing is not that smooth. You can't expect it to go 0-50 in 4 seconds but it's pickup is very good for it's capacity of 110 cc. It is giving me an excellent 60kilometers+ per liter mileage in all conditions. And it is giving me even 75 kilometers per litres when ride at 60 speed on highways. And i faced problems with tires cause the air the tires decreasing some 10 points regularly. Finally what i can say is for the price range of 50-57 thousands this is the value-for-your-money bike as per my experience. Thank you for reading my review. Hope it will help you.
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,low maintainance,4,i purchached this  bike  about before  8 yrs. .  but my  bike  never  failed  me to  reach to  the destination.. 
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,"Good bike for this price , Need quality improvement",2,"Im from middle class family, other bikes on 110cc segment is to costly than this.. so I choose to go tvs star city plus, After 90 KM's run I found pin hole in silencer pipe , I went to showroom .. they accepted this issue and promise to replace it . I'm waiting more than 1 month still I didn't get that, they said silencer wasn't coming.. I'm working on car manufacturing field and well known about welding quality, as a manufacturer I'm surprised that how they send poor repaired leaking silencer to selling?? Is they have quality team or not ?? Is they inspected or not ?? Now I feel bad . I thought I should go to Honda or hero bikes . "

TVS Star City Plus,4.4,Stunning performance,5,"I was expecting the bike performance to be good but it gives beyond to it. The smoothness while driving, mileage , shock absorbance capacity is good compare to other bikes. If we use it properly I am pretty sure that bike will perform same as new bike.You can enjoy the ride simply anywhere. I loved this bike"
TVS Star City Plus,4.4,Good bike with decent mileage but less speed.,4,"Since it is a mileage bike and not power bike so you can drive it at a max speed of 80 km/hr which I don't prefer since it can barely stand that speed. You can run it smoothly with a speed upto 50 km/hr. Above this it will create noise which is not good as it degrades the bike. Average is good about 65-70 kmpl. Look wise also good as it is not that much slim like splender and others. Well designed with good specs but for people who love speed, its not for you."

TVS Jupiter,4.4,Amazing TVS Jupiter,5,"After proper research, I chose TVS Jupiter and it was the best decision of my life. The best part is on uneven Indian roads we don't feel tremors.  It also provides good Mileage. It is spacious and very comfortable. Jupiter gives a buttery smooth driving experience. It's 2 years now but has not encountered a single flaw. I would recommend all to choose this vehicle blindly and you will never regret. Best after-sales service too at a reasonable cost. "
TVS Jupiter,4.4,"Bad product, disappointed ",1,"I own a Honda Activa for the last 4 years and bought a TVS Jupiter last year in October. But after using it for the last 10 months, I'm not at all satisfied with the performance & faced many issues. The battery didn't last for 8 months, got it replaced by the company. The millage is not as what the company claims. It's speedometer wire just snapped out. Its pickup is not good. I just wanted to buy an Indian brand but they don't give value for money. The only plus point is when we go for service it's good & fast. One star is only for service otherwise the company is not giving a good product. Very disappointed. "
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Best Bike On The Road,5,"Awesome bike to travel. Nice comfort, looks and design. Best bike in the market right now. You can rely on this bike for long drives also. Again the bike has a very large space which helps you to carry as much as possible luggage with you plus having a charging slot which gives me no worries about battery life. "
TVS Jupiter,4.4,An outstanding performance ofJupiter,5,"After purchasing TVS Jupiter ZX Grande, I feel a good level of ride comfort because of two things, first is quality suspension and another is a bigger dia wheel than any other scooter. Some more facility is outside fuel filling point and digital meter and LED Headlamp which reduce the battery consumption. TVS ZX Grande has a nice colour complexion and better mileage. So in my view, Jupiter is better than any other scooter."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,My Experience of jupiter,4,"Its a good experience of buying TVS Jupiter. Its weight is lighter than Honda Activa & I am using it for daily purposes. I had a problem with the side stand of it & solved by the agency. Service is good & I will also recommend my friend to purchase the TVS Jupiter from there if they need. To be honest, Now after 1 year, I have a problem with leakage of engine oil with it. I hope it would be solved soon."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter at it's level best,5,"This is way better than Activa series as it can go a long distance in one go than in activa and also has good leg space for the rider. As well as, it has a steel body which is better than fiber body if an accident happens there is less damage to the vehicle and also it is comparatively cheaper than other vehicle in this section. Also, it is comparatively good than other vehicles in this gearless section."

The pass-by switch is unique as it allows us to easily switch between the high and low beam with easy press and auto release which is very helpful while overtaking. The new type of bag hook, the best part is front and rear wheel size is 12 inches. It is the best scooter in 110 CC segment and overall performance is good.

TVS Jupiter,4.4,All In one Package....Im just Loving It.,5,Jupiter was my always 1st and last choice. I bought this bike in last month. It feels really awesome to ride this bike. Main advantage of this bike is it has telescopic front suspension which is quite important while driving on Indian roads. It gives you very smooth ride as compared to other bikes. Second thing is it has external petrol filling point which is very helpful I guess. This is very light weight bike. It has cool and stylish aerodynamics look plus alloy wheels which gives very awesome look. Overall this bike is a great package of all things. So just go for it guys.... 
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Good scooter ,1,I have a Jupiter but I'm unhappy with service centre in vasco da gama Baina. Very pore services they are pervading for customer. At date now 4 days complete.

TVS Jupiter,4.4,"Good vehicle to women, and comfortably used by others too. ",4,"Everything is fine, but box with lock and key, mobile charger may cost Rs.300/- in lot, but satisfies all customers which was neglected by the comapny. Better provide to all owners of jupiter, as there is no scope for secured storage( storage under seat is for helmet which cannot be ignored). You should not forget that this is especially made for women and who looks for a good storage space, which is neglected. Better think again, if it is possitive inform me as my wife needs a storage box. "

TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter – Guts to Fight Honda Activa,4,"For many years, Honda Activa was the invincible leader in the scooter segment but since the advent of scooters like Jupiter, the king of the ring is in danger of dethroning. This is my review after driving my steed over 8,000 kms. At first glance, one will hardly notice any difference between the two as both looks the same. Jupiter possesses the excellent combination of power and mileage. Feature-wise too, it stands shoulder to shoulder to Activa. Though I read a lot of reviews regarding noisy suspension, I didn’t notice any such disturbance while driving. However, if you push your limits, especially on highways, then the suspension might play spoilsport. The external fuel filling has been a blessing for a lazy person like me. It’s not surprising that in such a short period of 3-4 years, TVS Jupiter has become a common sight on our roads. Just last week I recommended the same to my friend. Overall, I am quite satisfied with my decision and still loving my Jupiter. "
TVS Jupiter,4.4,WORST WORST WORST ,1,"it goes very smooth in starting but just after 12000km its a garbage.worst start,,worst battery,,and most worst thing you want to know is of about its service .i had bought tvs jupiter millionr edition from sneh tvs jhansi,,they dont care anything about the customer.they usuaaly take 4-6 hours to service your vehicle(promise of 60 min service).they try to fool you, i got my jupiter after 5 hours and at night it was hard to check everything and when i look in the morning firstly the key was broken ,battery was not working,,kick start was not helpful.they had taken 1130 rs for this bull shit service .advice you never buy a tvs vehicle ,they dont care about you.BECOME INTELLIGENT DONT BUY THIS GARBAGE,,#JAAGO GRAHAK JAAGO"

It's an engine, not a living thing to improvise, don't tell your customer that after 1st and 2nd service it will give mileage. That's bull shit. An engine is an engine."

TVS Jupiter,4.4,just go for it...,5,Tvs Jupiter is the most suited bike for all who loves to go without gear. the rides are smooth and nice. the mileage is good enough. look wise it is the most beautiful scooter present in the Indian scooter market.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,A Wonderful Ride!!,5,"Riding TVS Jupiter for about a month now and I've got no major issues with it to date. The ride feels smooth on bumpy roads and balancing it is easy. Ladies feeling it'll be tough for them to handle this bike.. well it isn't. It's just as easy as it's predecessor, TVS scooty. Only people with short stature would find it a bit difficult. Mileage is pretty decent which returns more than 50 kms in the city. Costs bit more than other 110 cc scooters. I've got the million R edition with disc and alloy wheels so maybe it seems costly to me. Overall it's real value for money."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Nice Product,4,I purchase my TVS Jupiter on 01/02/2017; Now i can conclude it is very good Sooty as compare to Honda Activa (as I already owned Activa 110cc since January; 2013) as far as Riding comfort and smoothness of Engine.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Good Scooter,4,"TVS Jupiter is good in mileage and in the pickup. Its impressive top speed is 90 km/l.  But in-ground clearance they Mentioned there is 165 mm, But  One Bad thing is in any Hump the bike's stand is touching and it makes soo noise. It is better than Activa."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Lights  are always  ON ,3,I have got a 4G Jupiter 3 weeks  back and  find that there is no provision for switching off lights during the  day.  Is  this  by design or by rule  ??  
TVS Jupiter,4.4,real experience,1,Worse as compare to other available options. after sell service is very poor. mileage & suspension are 3rd class. no improvement even after repeated servicing. i have try everything to improve mileage but......result is wasting money. 
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Noting Is Better Than Jupiter Juss Go For It,5,I was Using My Jupiter Since Last Two Years It Probably Giving Best Mileage About 45-55 kmpl And In Comfortability It Is Just Too Good .Better part is That it's  Resale Value Is Good Like Honda Activa
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Best Budget Scooter in Indian Market! ,4,"Though it looks like a scooter made for male, its good for females too. A female of 5"" height can comfortably drive and handle the bike easily."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Good bike if u have range of 50-60,5,It really has more space than activate 4g
TVS Jupiter,4.4,For performance prefer other.prefer this byk only for look.,2,Poor colour.poor pick up.poor.good features.heavy weight.good length only for gents.poor milage.jest 40 km.good look.poor luggage hooks no quality.foot rests and kick rod at same place so v have problems foot can touch kick rod during travel.poor shock absorbers.main stand very poor quality.good wheels.bad and poor tyres slips every time.mud gears should be more long.poor plastic body cover s used.very bad quality plastic.head light should be more bright.nice seat cover.nice look.

TVS Jupiter,4.4,Very Good Scooter in Good Price range,4,I Bought TVS Jupiter on 9th Dec-17. it run Very Smooth. i really very happy with this product. i had drivern 650 kms. i drives in economy mode it's give 57km/liter average.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Fiber parts are not matched proper extra gap is there,2,I have bad. Experience by dealer and finishing parts of fibre are not properly fitted and no one is take a responsibility of its and mileage is not satisfied it gives 45 nearby
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Marvelous scooter,3,"though it looks like a scooter made for male, its good for females too.  A female of 5"" height can comfortly drive and handle the bike easily."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Better than any other scooter,5,"I have always been a great admirer of TVS scooters but since Jupiter has been launched in the market. I have become a true fan of TVS. I also purchased this scooter for my sister, who has started going to college on that smart piece of machine. She tells me how smooth it is and how happy she is to have it and I think I am a better brother now. I brought her a Silver colored Jupiter and I think the scooter is returning a mileage of 45kmpl as per my calculations. She says that the ride is quite smooth and both the suspensions are highly comforting."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,BEST LOOK WITH GOOD MILAGE,5,"I Bought the new Jupiter 110 cc for me and I am really happy with the scooter. The new TVS Jupiter is one of the best scooters available in the market now days, with a 109.7cc air cooled engine, it churns out a power of 5.88 kW and 8 Nm torque. The TVS have reached the goal of having 5 Lac happy customers on Jupiter all India wide. The Jupiter achieves a good mileage figure of 50 KMPL easily on average in the city (Jaipur) and 55 KMPL highways. With this The look and the feel are really good, and availability of different colours options makes it a better choice of ladies. The beige colour panels are really good looking. It has dura cool seats which offer longer drive. And One of the best things I liked about it is that the petrol inlet is at the back. Hence, I don’t have to get down every time I want to fill in petrol. My suggestion to everyone out there is to go ahead and but TVS Jupiter. You will not regret it."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,"comfortable ride, good pickup and good looks.",5,"it is absolute comfort to ride this , i travel more than 10  kms daily it has nice suspensions."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,tvs jupiter,3, it was a better with compare to activa just give some more graphics in jupitor
TVS Jupiter,4.4,My jupiter,5, My name is Divya rastogi and I  Have been using TVs Jupiter for last 2 years . I am very happy with its performance. Its ride is smooth and I didn't come across any problem regarding to my scooty. Its mileage is awesome.... It is giving an average of 50km/litre. Its engine is good. It has alloy wheels. Seat is really comfortable and space under the seat is really good . its front light looks very stylish and as its back light. Balance is great... I rode it at the speed of 60km/hr comfortably. I have used it for long drive it has given good mileage and riding on my jupiter is  comfortable every time and in all seasons . it is really a great scooty to trust even for slippery roads in rainy season. I need not to fear from scooty starting problem which is quite common with other scooters in winters when temperature is low. It offers me one touch start which saves my time and energy and saving time is equivalent to saving money and at last I want to say that my scooty is perfect for me when I need to drop my child to school. Thank you..
TVS Jupiter,4.4,decent ride,3,"I have bought my jupiter four month back, the only thing which attract me to buy is its fuel consumption mileage but after using for four months it hardly gives 35 mileage now the good part is that its engine sound is very low no other  scooter can beat Jupiter in terms of engine and running sound.looks are also silent and simple,the service machinq told that it gives 45+ mileage after 3rd service.pickup and power is also very less but that is fine with me,coz i am riding a scooter.overall good scooter and run silently but if u want power and pickup then don't buy it. "
TVS Jupiter,4.4,It is awesome Jupiter ,5,"Looks wise it is the most beautiful scooter present in the Indian Market ,average goes near about 40 - 45 km per liter which is very impressive , having good space in digi and the best part is you don't need to open diki on petrol pump petrol tank is given out side the digi and that is the most comfortable thing I found in this , another best part is that it comes with a parking light which I rarely seen on anyother scooter of this range. "
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Good scooter.could have been better...,4,I got my TVS Jupiter 40 days back.I have found the scooter stopping at times when the speed goes below 20kmpl.I have to kick start the scooter whenever it stops.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS JUPITER ,4,"it is the most suited bike for all who loves to go without gear.The high performance 110cc CVT-i Engine generates a power of 8.2 PS and its CVT-i technology delivers the best-in-class combination of power & fuel economy. Those desiring more involvement can take advantage of the ""Power"" mode to let me get the most power out of the vehicle's high revving engine.ype 4 Stroke,Single cylinder,Air Cooled,OHC"
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Guru of scooters,4,Its been 2 months since i purchased my TVS scooter and I think it is a good enough time to write a review on it.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Mileage & Ride Comfort on road is too Good....  ,5,"This is the Best bike for buy. Why?  I tell you. Because of its Mileage-almost 55 kmpl which is best in city, Riding comfort is too good as compare to all other mopeds(It feels like we are seating in a car),Eco meter and pass light switch is very useful on road, Looks are so sexy as we see in any angle, Blue metallic color is attractive, More space on front side (we can place a gas cylinder), Service center's service is satisfactory at least for me cos I don't know about others, Best bike for all users."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Additional Features makes it different in the catagory,5,"The bike is very light, does not feel like driving a bike. Means easy to handle . Nearing system is excellent as both the breaks get applied even if you press lever of one. Moulded wheels. Spacious utility tray. Helmet or a football is easily accommodated. Lights are always on as per the new standards for the bikes, hence should be kept on dipper when not needed or in the day time. Just need to see if they can offer a on/off switch if permitted by standards. Some guys drive always on upper and that troubles the other side drivers. In the starting itself got approx 50 km per litre average milage."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,My Dream TVS,5,TVS Jupiter is my first scooty in my life and i m very happy with TVS Jupiter. 
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Very bad experience,1,Company claims 62 kmpl. BUT it have never given more than 34. Rather it had remain between 30 to 35 kmpl only. Visted several times to its service centre. ALSO serviced under compamy's authorized engineer. But all waste.

TVS Jupiter,4.4,Best  scooty .,4,I bought a new TVS Jupiter ZX with disc brakes on 5th of December 2017. It's a great bike .I really enjoyed riding the bike.It doesn't give more than 40kmpl  in city limits though the advertised mileage is 62kmpl.The shock absorbers are excellent and give you a most joyous ride.I am unable to upload photos of my vehicle .BikeDekho says the photo should not be more than 2mb.

TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter The champ of scooters,5,TVS Jupiter is the second best scooter in the Indian market after Activa. Deciding the colour of the vehicle was much of a task for me as it is available in 11 colours. The suspension felt really good on city bumps and overall the vehicle has good performance. Although the suspension does not absorb many shocks past the 50 kmph shock. TVS Jupiter seems like a vehicle which has stuck perfect balance affordability and aspiration.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Very much handy and easy to test drive for new riders.,4,"Its been a pleasure to buy Jupiter ZX disc, it gives me a classy feelings and very much comfort when i drive for long drive. Though its pick up is little bit slow, but rather than it gives vibration less motion."

Side mirror mounted on it give you a royal feeling while driving. Leg room and dicky is spacious. Very easy to fill your fuel while seating. The best, enjoyed my mansoon date on it and she finds it very exciting. Thank you TVS!!"
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Marvelous scooter,5,"Style: though it looks like a scooter made for male, its good for females too. A female of 5"" height can comfortly drive and handle the bike easily."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Zyada ka nuksaan is the perfect title for it,2,Jupiter has a very big issue of self start. The self start becomes un operational from the very first day. Even the company mechanics are not able to find out the key reason for this problem. Due to this one had to suffer a lot and also the company is not changing the defective scooty which creates the problem on daily basis. So i don't recommend it buying due to this reason only. Otherwise everything is good.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,"True to it's tag line, Zyaade ka Faayda",4,"Jupiter has been a wonderful purchase so far. The mileage has been consistently 48+ in city driving conditions and the ride quality is very good. Has a good pick  up, leg room, boot area, braking and "
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Mileage Issue,3,"It is been 10 months i have been using this scooter, the performance is Okay, i see it is giving Max of 40 KMPL, and engine sound so bad, Seat is soft and slippery,rear brake is not working from the day one, and service guys never fixed it. Over all this bike is not worth for that proice"
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Better then activa,5,"I bought jupiter grande disc edition on 2nd November 2018. Everyone was suggesting me to go with activa as activa has better resale value in there point of view. But let me inform you reader I'm now ????% satisfied with my jupiter, it's pickup is just good enough, there is no competitor in if we talk about comfort it provides while riding on road. It has all time best alloy wheels on both rear and front side wich activa doesn't have. Fuel gauze is outside the seat but i think fuel tank is not so big it only has 4 Ltr fuel capacity in practical life but milage it provide is great, usually I got 48+ milage every single time."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Its a comfortable and attractive scooter to honda activa scooter black panter colour awesome of jupi,5,"It is a scooter which has been designed to make your life as easy as possible. You get an external fuel-filler cap which saves you the effort of lifting up the seat every time you need to fill up. It gets a pass-switch, which is an important feature to have while riding at night. Should you wish to charge your phone, you can also ask TVS to fit your Jupiter with a mobile phone charger as well. It always had 12-inch tyres with alloy wheels and telescopic suspension. "

TVS Jupiter,4.4,MY TVS Jupiter ,4,"Awesome scooter I purchased it on 1st May 2014. I was impressed by the design, look, comfort and mileage of the scooter. It's a scooter and differs from the bike. I was unsure about the mileage claimed by TVS 62km/ltr. When I decided to check the fuel economy of the scooter I did following exercise. I made the fuel tank totally empty by driving it till the last drop of petrol. When it stops at 102 kilometre due to an empty tank. I filled 4.5Ltr petrol which I had carried separately in the can. I started driving, ( for safety precaution I kept half a litre of fuel in a bottle separately) after driving the vehicle between 20 to 40 km/ph at economy mode ( green indicator in meter ) in about 10 to 12 day my shooter stopped at 354.8Km. As the fuel tank got empty. So in 4.5 Litre petrol, I got the mileage of 252.8 Kilometre (354.8Km - 102km) so my scooter gave me a mileage of ""56.17Km/ltr"" hope that I get improve mileage after for servicing and it may touch 60 kilometres per litre. I would like to add that this test was carried at 50% of village roads n 50% highway... Damn happy with scooter... The only problem with a scooter is a bit less comfortable for a tall person like me of 5""11...So can't get the comfort like my Pulsar...But after all its a scooter. Top features.... 1. Huge storage space I can keep my full-size helmet in the boot. 2. Two luggage hooks.. 3. Great suspenshion..Thanks to its 12 inches wheels n gas charged suspension 4. Tubeless tyres 5. External fuel filling 6. Catchy look 7. Economy & low fuel indicators in metres 8. A hand brake and many more improvement needed... 1. Digital meter 2. Side stand indicator 3. Fuel reserve option 4. Disc brake."

Hero Maestro is on third position, Honda Activa is on second due to petrol opener under the seat, but I must say TVS Jupiter is on number 1 position for its toughness, body type and other specifications. I wrote this review after using TVS Jupiter for 2 months. Yes of course mileage is less but every scooter gives you almost the same so that is not a point.

Then I went to the showroom of TVS and spoke to the counselors there and they assured me that I am not making any mistake by purchasing it. I bought and drove it and I liked it better than other scooters as it is very comfortable and it also surpasses the Honda Activa in terms of mileage and average. There is an unmatched mix of superior technology.  I would like to thank the entire team of TVS who made this.

TVS Jupiter,4.4,The Best 110 cc Scooter With Premium Features,5,"When I was planning to buy a scooter the first name comes in mind is Activa due to the popularity of its name itself ... But when I did some research on other options like Jupiter was my instant go-to choice. TVS Jupiter is the best value for money scooter due to its features, built quality, appealing looks and multiple variants as per needs! colours as well as budget. Need of disc brake option was a must for me which wasn't even optional in Activa in 110 cc segment. Other features were also very interesting as some scooters just get 12-volt socket where you need to buy charging adapter and USB cable but with Jupiter, we get a built-in adapter and us just neet to plug in the USB cable. Such minor features do make some difference. And lastly, my choice was the classic variant with brown and beige dual-tone colours with those chrome accents just look charming. And also most importantly Activa didn't have decent mileage figures at all. Totally Satisfied with my choice."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Stylish Scooter,5,* Excellent riding comfort 
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Better Choice Over Activa 5G,5,Its design is superb...Echo and power mode saves a lot of fuel. Pick up and mileage also great. Compare to Activa 5g.

I suggest you to buy jupiter instead of other scooter.

TVS Jupiter,4.4," A Punchy, Stylish, and Modern Package",5,"Honda Activa might be the top-selling scooter in India, but the TVS NTORQ is in a completely different altogether. The 124.79 cc engine with 9.4 PS and 10.5 Nm is punchy enough and helps in quick acceleration. Then the Bluetooth connectivity features like call alerts, navigation, and auto-reply to messages is another nifty addition to the scooter. Style-wise, I believe that the TVS NTORQ is probably one of the best looking and a truly sporty scooter."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Great Design And Features,4,This review is after 50 days of usage. 
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Why Run After Activa When You Have Jupiter Classic,5,"Already having owned a couple of Honda Activa scooters in the past, I thought it was time for a change and decided to bring home TVS Jupiter Classic.

I hope the scooter is able to retain its mileage figures as the time passes."

TVS Jupiter,4.4,"Life ain't always beautiful, but it's a beautiful ride With TVS Jupiter",4,"Good Comfortable ride but sometimes in the morning, it takes time to start. You need to use a kick or chock to start the Vehicle. Apart from that good ride experience, ample storage space.

I have already been to the service centre for over five times but the folks just can’t make it work properly. They’ll do a thing and the fuel indicator will work for 1-2 days before dying again. Since the scooter is under warranty, I’ll have to force them to replace the required parts to make this thing work. Not very happy to be honest."

Very pliant ride with no undulations on potholes, speed breakers- thanks to the telescopic suspension at the front and those 12-inch tyres at the front and back. Smooth like butter compared to my old Activa which was a workhorse but not a joy to ride. Has a large 6 ltrs petrol tank with a 21 ltrs under storage, both larger than Activa. Have done 1st service recently and no complaints with the service either, however, compared to the honda, the service center set up and manpower was less impressive. May be this was for the specific dealer I went to. Overall a no-nonsense buy and very satisfying experience."

The LED DRLs are bigger and better than before and the headlamp is now split into two parts for the low and high beam. The company claims that the new unit offers segment-best penetration and spread and we will be able to confirm this only when the bike comes to us for a proper road test. Apart from this, the BS6 model gets new race-inspired graphics, all thanks to which the bike looks more appealing than before. The rest of the elements like side panels, fuel tank, exhaust, and the rear section are exactly the same as the previous BS4 model.

Annoyed with this issue, again I handed over my NTORQ to the same agency. I came to know that other NTORQ owner also facing the same issue which yet to be resolved.

Other features are way ahead of what is expected in this segment. Not a bad choice."

TVS NTORQ 125,4.4,Throttle goes vroom! ,4,"The vehicle is one of a kind , you get that wide section tyre on the rear , mean looking side profile and all the thing that would have been catching your attraction . It is no less than a bike . The bassy exhaust just fills up your heart , when you want a performance then mileage isn't a concern . If you're a tourer kind of person this vehicle easily rolls at 100kmph without any disturbance or any kind of vibration . It has got everything that a person would have been looking for in a bike apart from that geared engine . I would give it a 4/5 stars . It misses out on 1 star because of its lacing feature of connectivity to IOS ! "

TVS NTORQ 125,4.4,Entorq gets a 4,4,"I drove the Entorq yesterday for a very short distance and the vehicle is absoluteley amazing compared to the other 125 scooters. TVS has gone a notch above the rest. The styling, the finish and the handling is indicative that TVS has come a long way in refining their scooters. After testing both Aprillia and Entorq, I felt Entorq handling and the road grip is more than the Aprillia. If TVS had managed to get the google maps on the screen then it would have been excellent. I would settle for 4* for this scooter. I have already booked the scooter and am waiting for the delivery."

TVS NTORQ 125,4.4,The beast on the road..,5,"I've been using the NTORQ125 since one month and this scooty is just awesome. Till now no complaints. In terms of pickup, power looks it is all above. The mileage is also good , I'm getting mileage of 43kmpl. This is the average mileage of  most of the scooty in the market. Overall I'm happy with the scooty. Just go for it. The smart bluetooth console is very nice. While driving at least I can know that who is calling me as the name of the person is getting displayed. At high speeds it gives a nice balance. I've driven up to 96kmph. Guys the exhaust sound of this scooty is some what like Apache.. U will feel like u r driving a bike. It's too good and different."
TVS NTORQ 125,4.4,Awesome look and a good ride!!,5,Different from traditional scooter. Look and engine sound is just awesome. Sleek look.

TVS NTORQ 125,4.4,"The new TVS NTorq 125 scooter ticks all the right boxes when it comes to performance, refinement, fe",5,"Fun to ride. Edgy and stylish! TVS says that the design of the NTorq 125 has been inspired from stealth fighter jets. Looking at all the edges and panels, one might get the idea that the design is too busy, but looking at it in the flesh, it feels just right. TVS wanted to target the millennials and what it calls 'Generation Z' with the NTorq 125 and has kept the styling as such. The front apron is nicely raked with LED DRLs that are integrated into the headlamp unit. View it from the rear and first thing that you notice are the triangular faux vents flanking the tail lamp, which look rather stylish and butch. Adding to the scooter's sportiness are bits of faux carbon fibre finish and aluminium footpegs. The overall design itself is fresh and likeable. So the looks of the scooter gets a big thumbs up. The average of bike before servicing  is about 35-40 and after service it gives around 40-45 in city on highway it will give you 45-55 overall it is a package and gives you all that you need in your daily ride. "
TVS NTORQ 125,4.4,"Ntor 125, review",4,"I have spent another two months in the city commuting on our TVS Ntorq and have managed to add another 2000km on the clock.

Flanking it are two small faux air scoops which make it look so cool that anyone would love to buy it. However, It is very light and catches speed very fast, so you need to be careful handing this demon."

Having had the 1st gen Activa since 2002, I wasn't in the mood to go with Honda again. That's when the NTorq burst onto the scene and it only took us a week to decide on getting this bike home. It's now been almost 6 months and the bike has been an absolute blast to ride in the city. It happily embarrasses bigger bikes and it's so much fun to ride. Yes, small things like no LED lighting are there but it's not a deal breaker as far as we are concerned. Go for it and I'm sure you will not regret it. Well done TVS :-)  "

I use it pillion everyday for about 45-50 Km and it never disappoints you. Power is just what you need in city or highway. Sound is best compare to any scooter.

The connectivity system is good for android user, However, except the call display and few digital indicators nothing much is useful in day t day life. Map/Direction is not effective in real world. However it definitely an added feature."

Very stable, light, great pick up, fuel efficiency over 40 km to a litre. Only Con so far is ride is slightly bumpy on pockmarked roads inspite of telescopic suspension. But then, I do not use the bike extensively for long rides - mostly 20 km radius."

TVS NTORQ 125,4.4,Starting Problem,1,Never buy a TVS bike. Faulty bikes made by TVS company. And never buy bikes from Suryapratap motors as well. Recently I bought Ntorq from Bangalore.After buying within one week only it gave starting problem .so many times it has stopped in the ring road. My friends suggested that go for Honda Activa as it is a proven product and they have been using Honda Activa since five years still they have not faced a situation where the scooty has been stopped in the middle of the road.
TVS NTORQ 125,4.4,Starting problem,1,"Never buy TVS scooters. Faulty scooters made by TVS company. And never buy scooters from Suryapratap Motors as well. Recently I bought a TVS NTORQ from Suryapratap Motors, Bangalore. After buying within one week only it gave the starting problem. So many times it has stopped on the Ring Road, Bellandur, near to eco space while coming back from office. My friends suggested that go for Honda Activa as it is a proven product and they have been using Honda Activa since five years still they have not faced a situation where the scooter has been stopped in the middle of the road. Even they do not start their scooter through kick regularly as well till now. And also my sister is using Honda Activa for five years in a row. I can say don't go for the features in TVS scooters, it is of no use if your scooter is going to stop in the middle of the road. Why should I take tension after spending 85000 Rs to get a faulty new scooter. TVS guys are telling me it has 5 years of warranty, if any problems will occur in future we will take care of that. But my concern is why every time I should feel insecure that this scooter might stop in the middle. I am totally harassed. And believe me, I will make sure that TVS ratings will be zero from now onwards. I will post this review everywhere and make sure not a single TVS bike will sell after some time from any of your showroom in India. I will make youtube videos and everything. Requesting all the online users to check other forums as well for reviews of TVS. One classic example you can see from your eyes that if you visit any showroom in Bangalore of TVS see the public and visit showrooms of Honda Activa and see the buyers. And believe me, you will get empty showrooms of TVS as compared to Honda Activa. And make your decision on your self. I want my money back to buy Honda Activa. That's all."

TVS NTORQ 125,4.4,It is a good scooter with superb mileage,5,"TVS NTORQ 125 is really one of the best scooters in the 125 CC segment. I am done with 2500 KMS and I feel it a worth buy for your everyday use to office. I use it with pillion every day for about 45-50 KMS and it never disappoints you. Power is just what you need in the city or on highways. Sound is best compared to any scooter. Comfortable to sit and ride for long hours also. The connectivity system is good for android user, However, except for the call display and few digital indicators, nothing much is useful in day to day life. Map / Direction is not effective in the real world, however, it is definitely an added feature. Improvements - Yes, the petrol tank size is too less compared to the mileage we get. The full tank gives you 150 KMS which is too less as I have to top up my tank every third day. I am getting constant mileage of 35 KMPL, hoping it may improve after the second service which is due already at 2500 KMS. Another drawback is the unavailability of Apple Phone's connectivity. This should be treated immediately as iPhone users like me will start avoiding the scooter despite having such good features."

At last lost hope and bought a glossy white. The day it got delivered it was troubling in getting self start. The dealer told to give chok and start because it is new one. From that day it became a daily routine and do not start without it. Later it stopped working that too. In middle of a road I have to drag the bike to get it started and look like a fool running with a new bike .

TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,Great Bike,4,"Overall a great bike to own. I have been riding this bike for more than a year now and have completed 10,000 + kilometres. It has some vibrations but they aren't very harsh. You won't notice any anyway. In traffic, it turns into a pure commuter and on highways, it becomes a hardcore sports tourer. Don't think, just go for it."
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,Overall Great Bike,4,"I have been riding this bike for more than a year. I rode it for around 11,000 kilomtres and i havent faced any major issues with it. I really loved the way its instrument console is put together. Gives you a lot of information. In simpler words, it can be a pure commuter in traffic as well as a perfect sports tourer on open highways. For the in depth review of my bike, do check this video out:"
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,Bang for the Buck!,4,"I have completed 2500kms on the bike and it has been a pleasure riding it every kilometer. The bike feels at home when it is in traffic and it pulls like a breeze with its good low end and excellent midrange. In the highways though the bike feels a bit out of breath after 120kmph, obviously the reason being the short gearing with the large rear sprocket. As a result its not bright to expect a strong top end from the bike. The bike is perfect in the way it is designed. The maintenance is also inexpensive as it's a TVS. Overall a sporty and a perfectly handling bike."
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,Wonderful bike!!,5,"A very balanced bike in the 200 segment. It is a perfect balance between power and safety. Although the power is a bit less than ns200 and rc200, this bike will ensure that you are very much safe on the road, with the dual channel ABS and many other features.  Even the power is very good and the bike never disappoints you on the road. It would be wrong to compare this to KTM or NS because although they are same segment, their purpose is completely different. I am using this one as a daily commute bike and very much satisfied with the performance. The only con is it's headlights. The headlight is completely useless. Even a mobile LED torch is better than this headlight. In night time, you cannot see anything on the road because the halogen light is very dim even in up beam. The horn is very good, and sounds very nice like a car horn. And the best part about this bike is the exhaust note. The exhaust sound is just wonderful. The exhaust note grabs everyone's attention and you'll love it. The ABS is wonderful. You can cruise at high speed without worrying much about the braking. Braking is wonderful."
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,perfect for city and highways,4,"its been more than one year i have been using this bike now, there was waiting period for a week i guess but it was worth waiting for."

TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,my bad luck,2,after buying this bike i faced a huge prblm u can say.my bike's prblm is related to engine.top speed achived is 100 only when it was new.tody its top speed is 88kmph.when try to throttle it up it jurks a lot n a khat khat noice is coming frm the engine.milage is also flactuating like 22 15 32 km/L. went to service center many times.but no result is out.dnt know what to do.this was my dream bike thats why i gave it 2 str.otherwise 2 star is not for this bike
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,don't miss it ,5,its  very cool in look and very awesome bike. the speed of the bike is impressive in acceleration and the the handling is superb than the others bikes of TVS and it has double exhaust but in other apache single exhaust very impressive  in all specification 
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,Beastly performance!,5,The bike is absolutely gorgeous with looks and performance but the service center of TVS is absolute fraud and the worst after sales service is shit. You should go for KTM or Bajaj their service is a lot better. However the bike sounds really good like a mini bullet and pickup is nice the best thing I like about the bike is the console and the matte finish.

TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,The bike that flows..  ,4,I was in HYD for my training..  As i returned i got this bike as a gift from dad.. Though we have booked the bike last month(DEC).. Reason y have i given the title so..  Is the bike just keeps you cruising so well..  The power delivery is so linear.. You wont feel any sort of lag while you drive along in the city..  I have not driven it much though(400km)..  Take these word as a first impression from my side..  I dont rush or rash while i drive..  So cannot comment on the hi-end power and speed..  I also own a RS200 which is very planted at hi speeds but struggles a bit in city..  So basically i understand what my need is..  And i have made a good call going for apache rather than any other..  
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,Brst performer around 1 lakh,5,Great bike....Best performer.......Lack of 6th gear is the only problem.......Gives a mileage of 40 in city riding and 45  in highways...
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,Switching Loyalty,5,I've been a hardcore fan of Pulsar and still believe it is the best thing that has happened to Indian biking. Pulsar upped the game for Indian manufacturers and has brought every other bike maker (Desi/ Videsi) to a larger arena.

TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,Astonishing look with decent performance.,5,Pros
TVS Apache RTR 200 4V,4.4,So bought my 3rd bike!! ,4,"Its been 2 months since i bought my apache. Its been a good experience so far, very good for city riding, the power delivery is very linear, low end torque is very good.. So this beast is best for riding in city traffic, believe me when i say this, i have driven 200ns for a week, but the ride experience you get in apache 200 is just perfect, there is literally no vibration in bike even at high rpms its really smooth, so done with the good points. Now something which tvs should improve in every apache there in the market is braking, brakes needs improvement, I am pretty disappointed with brakes, and tvs if you launch the bike with abs in 2016 you should provide it in bike, its been 1 year since release of the bike with dual channel abs and we were not getting it till the end of 2017, they have launched it just now in the market. ABS is really important in the bike, with the kind of roads in india and people,  you definitely need abs in the bike, that is the only reason i m not giving full stars. I am a happy customer,  tvs service has been good. I hope this suggestion helps anyone who wants to buy this bike... Good luck :D"

The power is mainly focused at the low and bottom end, the amazing digital instrument cluster and the dual-channel ABS made a better case for me.

TVS Star City Plus,4.4,Great bike go for it,5,"We have the 2006 first model, still running great with very good mileage and power. Drove 150000+ KMS, the built quality is very good in fact I have a Yamaha Fazer, the plastic quality of TVS Star City is better and thicker than Yamaha Fazer and also Honda Livo which my cousin has. Our bike was very badly maintained and in these 15 years time we had fully serviced the bike only 3 times, yes you read it right only 3 times. We didn't change the oil for 5 years (due to lack of awareness) because of which the mileage dropped, clutch plates damaged and a little wear and tear but now we change the oil after every 3000 KMS and now it is running smoothly with good mileage. The exhaust note is superb but the new TVS Star City Plus exhaust note is not that good. Top speed is around 75-80 KMPH but the new model is powerful and definitely can reach the ton. Rear suspension is not good we have changed it twice (but then there is our mistake too we didn't oil the suspensions at all and the suspension in the new model is good I think), once changed the clutch plate, twice changed the rear sprocket, the headlight isn't good (don't know about the new model), and indicator quality is not that good. No morning start problem with right tuning. vibration is there only at the top end and in normal speed, it is very smooth. no rattling, the high-speed stability could have been better but it is a totally city-focused bike in which it excels. And that's it, no major problems till now like the other bikes. This bike is very good for city use. Brakes are average, reliability is good and I cannot expect much from a second-hand bike as I bought it for Rs. 17000 only and maintained very badly and ridden harshly. It is one bike for lifetime. Thank you TVS for a quality product. If I will buy a new bike that will definitely be TVS as TVS has earned my trust. If you are looking for a city commuter with stylish looks, great mileage, good power and fun to ride with good pick-up then go for it and you will be happy."

TVS Sport,4.3,REALLY SPORT ( like Hima das) ,4,My review for my bike TVS Sport:-
TVS Sport,4.3,Simply Can’t Ask For More At This Price,5,"I purchased the TVS Sport in 2015 and over the course of 5 years, this machine has never failed or disappointed me. The major reason behind going for the TVS Sport was its fuel efficiency, and I have always got a mileage of over 65 km/l from this 100cc workhorse. While almost the whole motorcycle cycle is plastic, the parts are durable and long-lasting. The only part that ever broke down was the chain cover. Since it also made of plastic, a screw went down and the cover was cut due to coming in contact with the rear wheel. The replacement cost ₹ 450 the bike is just as fine as it was on day one."

Initially riding was good but afer 1yr bike start thrilling 2 time service complaint at authrised dealer bt no solution.Bike lock speed wire and self start get damage in 9 month. I repair them by paying bakwaas bike
TVS Sport,4.3,Not purchase tvs sports,3,Tvs sport good bike not exllient. 
TVS Sport,4.3,Disappointing Experience with the outcome. ,3,I have purchased TVS SPORTS ES BSIV model in November 2017. That blue coloured bike looks very impressive I must say that.  But the look is only good thing about the bike. The drawbacks are as follows. ..
TVS Sport,4.3,Experience with TVS not very well. ,3,TVS Suport is my third new bike. With this bike my experience is very bad. On the day of purchasing this bike am faced one problem of gear leaver hanging with this bike. I am never thinking about any problem in just new bike. After about this mileage is less than company commitment. During riding bike blasting from silencer. 
TVS Sport,4.3,TVS SPORT VERY POOR PICK AND PERFORMANCE,1,"I purchased TVS Sport in the year 2012 on the recommendation of TVS Service Centre mechanic. When I told him about changing my TVS Star City because it was 6 years old and started giving trouble. But after riding for a few months, It gave me disappointment only for its poor pick up and a year or two, the engine gets off while in running condition. I am not at all satisfied with TVS SPORT"
TVS Sport,4.3,Change the side stand..,4,Bike ka side stand jo hai ye sahi nhi hai bhut chota kache (mud) me ye dhass jaata hai ise thoda or chodai bhada do or driver ki left vali jo footres hai vo lambai me badi hai to bike niche lag jati hai plz is me change kare

Looks are great, mileage is 70+ (I have already tested at 60kmph inside city) , engine smoothness is butter like. The on If you want a bike that is total paisa-vasool, then this is the one for you. Without any second thoughts, go and buy this one. Looks are great, mileage is 70+ (I have already tested at 60kmph inside city) , engine smoothness is butter like. The only thing that I am unsatisfied about is the rear brake is loose, maybe that was from the beginning. The mechanic can fix it for you for Rs.10. Styling, comfort, economy, pickup, handling. All A1. It may be only 100 cc bike but then it is better than that camel bike called CD Deluxe and way better than the Passion. When you put the bike in 2nd gear and press the throttle, you can feel the engine rev up. And from 3rd gear you can take the bike till 60kmph. Awesome pickup. Reach 60 kmph within 8 seconds. I drove the bike at 85kmph while my brother says he took it till 100kmph."

TVS Sport,4.3,My best Bike,5,"First of all I got this bike as a gift from my uncle, then I thought that its not a good bike as it is a economy class bike.... But when I used it I felt I was wrong .. It gives pretty impressive millage about 70 to 75......   Acceleration is also good but not the best U can only get this much in such price... If u will drive it in proper way then it will give about 80 millage. I like its design and color availability. Mine is white with blazing red, it looks superb . And u can trust TVS company as it is an Indian company . Mine has not given any problems yet and u can easily find a service center in every city . I love my bike as it helped me a lot. Merits- Better Millage , Better durability , Better Performance , Better light , Nice colour options , Better price ,     Demerits - Acceleration is slow , Makes noise , Not comfortable while driving for long period , Less power only 100cc . In short its a better option for those who are millage conscious. Thanks"
TVS Sport,4.3,a very high class bike with a cheapest price,4,i am using this bike  from 7-8 months. it is a very classy bike as compared to its price point. the only problem of this bike is of its sound. it makes an unpleasant sounds at high speed.  but as it is a 100 cc bike it goes to much high speed as compared bajaj platina and hero deluxe. i have reached a speed of 95km/hr with this bike. the mileage is fabulous. overall i am very happy with this bike and suggest other buyers to buy this bike as it is a cheapest bike now a days with a sporty and dashing looks.
TVS Sport,4.3,Worst Mileage,1,"TVS Sport is one of the awesome bikes in the lower category. This bike is loaded with features that a common man needs....from last 1 year of purchase, I found the average is very poor approx 51 to 55 km/l. Not satisfied with the mileage of the bike."

It having nice handling at corners, comfortable suspension, new styling look & grate mileage in city with around 65 to 69km/l. It's new stunning look is very nice. But little bit it's break is not effective, I'm sending this problem to TVS state seller, he said ""one of the lot having low level break pad, which change now by the company."" Overall its superb Indian made bike..."

TVS Sport,4.3,dont take tvs bikes.......,2,it is the worst ever 
TVS Sport,4.3,Got wot i needed........,4,"accept the less gear speed ratio (which is the problem of every 100cc bike) and little noisy engine, this bike is good as per its specification, I owned one for 2 months, gear shift is smooth, better ride quality, it get shaky little bit above 70km/hr. but it reaches 92 km/hr in 14 secs, thats the max speed. Very happy with the mileage of 62km/lit as my average speed is on highway is always above 60km/hr. pickup is good; beside's this is third tvs product in my home after tvs champ and tvs scooty and so far now i have no regerts."
TVS Sport,4.3,Service issues with TVS Sport,3,"I am a businessman from Mumbai. I am passionate about cars and I own a few of them. I have a BMW X5, an Audi A6, a Range Rover Evoque and a Mercedes convertible. My servant used a Hero cycle to get vegetables for me from the market, he used to get really tired, so I decided to buy him a motorcycle. As I have never driven a motorcycle, I don’t have much knowledge about it. Since I am a big cricket fan and follow Virat Kohli, I decided to buy a TVS Sport for my servant because Kohli is the brand ambassador of it. After six months, my servant started complaining that the bike punctures a lot and the chain makes a lot of noise. According to what he told me, the fuel economy is good and the bike is very comfortable for riding in city but the maintenance cost is a bit too high. The bike needs service every couple of months and that is a bit frustrating because the bike is needed for work daily. I suggest that you should not buy a bike by only looking at the advertisements."
TVS Sport,4.3,"Value for money, fuel efficient",5,"TVS Motors thank you designing such an amazing motorcycle: TVS Sport. It is the most fuel efficient bike I have ever had, it returns me a mileage of above 60kmpl. The engine is smooth and complements the lightweight and makes the pick up just better than expectations. It has been over 2 years that I own this special bike and think I will cherish it for next few years as there is no big problem I have encountered with it. The battery seems to be down though and the tyres have lost its grip but I think that’s because of my long and frequent rides with my friends. "

Now it delivers mileage of 45-50 kmpl in city. Within the period of using I have come across some serious issue related to performance and  various parts of this bike. Before describing its issue, show you the positive side of this bike. The bike got attractive looks, Noise free engine, very comfortable seats, and the handling characteristics are awesome. The bike has very light in weight that makes it easy to handle. "

The engine is redefined and puts mileage of 68 kmpl highways and 62 kmpl in city. But the problem is with gearbox, the 1st and 2nd gear got stuck sometimes. I have told to service personnel's about this problem but did not get a reliable solution. The maintenance cost is very reasonable. "

TVS Sport,4.3,good bike with great milege(Tvs Sport),4,"TVS Sport gets most of its styling bits from its elder sibling Star city. It has a very compact design and looks sporty. The clear lens headlight with a tinted visor looks very stylish and doesn't look as flat as others like Bajaj Patina and Hero Splendor. TVS has used the all black colour theme on this bike with black silencer, engine and alloy wheels. New stylish graphics enhance the visual appearance of this bike. It uses orange coloured side indicators which complements the bike really well but should have been flexible. Rear profile also looks very compact with small, clear lens tail light, black coloured grab rail and short mudguard. Visually you can notice the extended length of its seat which covers some of the part of its fuel tank which has a fuel capacity of 12 litres."

It gives the mileage of approximately 75-85 kmpl.It is an ideal bike for the city ride despite complaints of vibration. Vibration is a big issue with TVS sport bike also. TVS sport offers expanding drum brakes. The expanding drum brakes works excellently in any conditions and keep the bike in safety.TVS Sport has a well designed handle, alloy wheels, broad tyres, streamlined body and a shoe-type seat that adds to the comfortable ride. The rear and front suspensions work well and help in realizing the maximum comfort level in this bike. It is an affordable bike in its price range.

TVS Sport,4.3,is it a gud bike?,2,"hello guys, i am from kolkata. I own a tvs sport white green in colour. I have covered almost 4000 kms with this bike but i would say this not a bike up to the mark. It had past only 10 months of my buying the bike but its battery got damaged, my cluth wire got damaged i changed 2 times but the result is same. The worst part of the bike is its sound. The sound of this is no unpleasent that i cant anything. It has vibrations at speed above 40. I admire its mileage which is adorable. It gives a mileage of about 70-80 kmpl which is quite impressive.

I have already made a complaint to TVS Dealership on every service I have done my 4 service already and V is pending but they are not able to sort out my problem even they are not able to set the mileage on 70 to 80 kilometres per litre.

If you are looking for something that can be your companion for your office commutes, the TVS Sport is a perfect package for the purpose."
TVS Sport,4.3,Pamper It Or It Will Fall Off,5,"The TVS Sport is a fine motorcycle for the price that is asks for. Besides, everything is plastic and eager to rattle unless you take good care of it. It needs to be serviced at every 2,500km to 3,000km in order to stay in shape. If you are considering getting one, be ready to treat it like a fragile commodity."
TVS Sport,4.3, Adding A Sportiness To Basic Commutes,5,"For an entry-level motorcycle, the TVS Sport looks smart and never feels aa if it is built to a cost.

TVS Sport,4.3,70+ KMPL Is Actually Achievable - TVS Sport ,5,"TVS markets the Sport has a highly fuel-efficient motorcycle and that is true as well. However, you need to ride this bike the way it is supposed to get the best out of it. I own a TVS Sport from August 2018 and have got up to 75 km/l from this bike. But if you ride likes you will ride an Apache or a Pulsar, the mileage drops down to 50-55 km/l. Ride smooth at around 40-50 km/h and the TVS Sport will surely return a mileage of over 70 km/l."
TVS Sport,4.3,Very fuel-efficient - TVS Sport,5,"I was looking for a bike that could easily return 50+ kmpl of fuel economy, and I went for TVS Sport because it not only looks sporty but performs flawlessly as well.

TVS Jupiter,4.4,Colours Are Best But Too Costly ,3,"Jupiter is the best scooter but prices are too high. No new features, same models, high prices. You attract customers by colours and not by models, due to this customers are not satisfied."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Mileage is good,4,I am using a TVS Jupiter Scooty for the past about 1 year.  Engine performance and gearbox everything is very good. The best scooter I have come across. I feel no back pain while riding a scooter. It's riding on potholes and speed breaker is never a hassle with this scooter as it floats when it crosses one. Mileage is good.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Vibration at 40 speed,3,"Pros: 12 inch wheels, fuel open/close system, front left storage. the easy center stands and kick start. Cons: TVS Jupiter makes rubbing noise during transmission between 35- 45 kmph. Other 10% may happen inside but we don't know. The paint looks very nice but glossy paint comes with poor quality. If you rub, a clear coat will fade. Have personal experience and common research to say Jupiter is smooth till 35 kmph and after 50 kmph."

I used it for travel from my office to home daily and I haven't fac any major problem till date. Moreover it looks quite heavy which suits my personality. I would definitely recommend it to everyone who are looking for a good scooter. 
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter Review,5,"I must start with the buying experience, I wanted to buy using cc but there was an extra charge for the cc payment, so I managed to buy by paying most of the amount in cash. Pros: 12 inch wheels, fuel open/close system, front left storage. the easy center stands and kick start. Cons: TVS Jupiter makes rubbing noise during transmission between 35- 45 kmph."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter Review,5, love TVS Jupiter
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter,5,It's very bad experience for me. New scooter stopped in road. Start button also not working. So it's very difficult situation for me to start it by using kick. Digital meter not working while I put 500 rs petrol in it. Front light is also not working from 8 days when I purchased brand new scooter. I recommend please do not purchase this scooter. It willwaste your money as well as time.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter Review,5,TVS Jupiter - Average is the demon  Suspension and pickup of TVS Jupiter is very good but when it comes to average its very low. Rest everything is superb. Comfortable for rides and under seat space is bigger than any other scooter present in the market. Petrol tank of this scooty is also in good place and its looks very beautiful also. New cpolours are good but TVS should improve their fuel efficiency or mileage. Servicing of TVS is also not satisfying.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter My Experience ,5,I have a very great experience with my TVS Jupiter scooty because when I ride it I feel very safe and secure. Maintenanace cost of it is very low and it gives very good mileage in the city also. Its lights and tyre sysems are like cherry on the cake. I think if anyone is thinking to buy a new scooter I will suggest to go for TVS Jupiter instead of Activa or Maestro.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter,5,Great Indian Scooter - I bought this scooter after many test rides of activa and Jupiter. The main advantages you will get in Jupiter while comparing to Activa are that it feels very light while riding. Acceleration of Jupiter is very fast as compared to Activa. It comes with very smooth engine and it got disc brakes which are not available in Activa. Both wheels have the same size of alloy. I have ridden it for almost 500 km and got a mileage 42 which I think is very good before first service.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter,5,"TVS Jupiter Ranks Number 1 - I'm the owner os Jupiter from last twon years and I will definetly say that this scooter is the kning of all scooters. I have previously used Honda Activa then switched to Jupiter and the reasons for which I switched were its design, comfort and fuel capaciy. I'm fully satisfied with my scooter. Scooter is loaded with many features but diamond cut look makkes it best."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,Worst in the market ,3,First of all don't beleive on the mileage which is shown in the ad. Its maximum mileage is 40 kmpl. Please have test ride before buying it with minimum quantity of fuel so that you can get idea of mileage. Moreover this scooty will give you a lot of trouble after 6-7 months. I would recommend everyone to not buy this scooter as per my experience this is the worst scooter present in the market.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter,5,"TVS - Brand We Can Trust - I must say Jupiter is the comfortable scooty present in the market as I have ridden Activa, Maestro, Duet and Wego but this scooty is very comfortable. Jupiter is also very safe scooter and mileage is also quite decent. While other scooters service are costly and service centres takes time but this is not the scenario in TVS service centre. They openly welcomes us and didn't take any extra time in serviving. I'm very satusfued with my both riding experience and service centre experience."
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter Review,5,Powerful Scooter - TVS Jupiter - TVS Jupiter comes with powerful 110 cc engine with 8.4 Nm torque which helps this scooter in giving powerful perfrormance. It comes with tubelss tyres and disc brakes which enhances its performance. This scooter is suitable for both boys and girls. Looks very stylish and different from other scooters available in the market. Moreover you can always trust the performance of the TVS products. Very excellent scooter. Worth to buy.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter,5,TVS Jupiter parts not good - The main problem that you will face in this scooter is its parts and build quality is not good at all. Moreover it requires servicing at very frequent intervals. Mileage of this scooter is also very low which will be a buden for evryone. The quality of service and the behaviour of the TVS staff after sales is also not good. Overall not a worth to buy this scooter. You can look for other scooters in the market.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter,5,TVS Jupiter- Average Scooter - According to me there is not much difference between Jupiter and other petrol scooters available in the market. One pro is that its seat is quite comfortable whih other scooters lack. Other then that this scooter is just an average scooter. Mileage of this scooter is also not very good. Moreover service provided by the TVS agency is very bad and behaviour of the staff members are also very bad. Its just an average scooter nothing more. Other options available in the market are also good. There is tough competition.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter - Very Comfortable ,5,I must say one thing about this scooter is that this scooter is way too much comfortable while riding it. You will not feel back pain and it runs very smooth on busy roads also. Pickup of this scooter is very good as compared to other scooter in the market. Mileage of this scooter is also very good. Very low cost maintenance. This scooter is suitable for both men and women. Anyone can use it for daily use. I am very happy to have it.
TVS Jupiter,4.4,TVS Jupiter,5,"TVS Jupiter - Best In The Business - According to my experience this scooter is the best scooter as compared to other scooters. It comes with TVS intelliGo technology, which turns off the engine while idling for a long time in traffic. The scooter also comes with an all-in-one ignition key slot for extra convenience. It also gets a large 21-litre underseat storage compartment and a sizable 2-litre cubbyhole on the back of the apron as well as mobile phone charging. Moreover its mileage is just amazing. Very comfortable to ride. Very low cost maintenance. Good choice for both boys and girls."

Yeah, the tire grip is not satisfactory on wet roads. Brakes are also good but rear shock absorbers give bad sound when it gets to a big ditch. It’s a bouquet of power, style, mileage and comfort. According to me Apache has got the toughest body, compared to Yamaha FZ. Handling wise it offers a good feel and shocks are quite responsive and make the ride enjoyable and happy. Engine sound is normal compared to all other 150cc four stroke bikes. The front brake is amazing but rear disc is little hard. If we apply both at the same time than it works great. Look wise it is quite different from all other bike, eye catching parking lights, clear head light and smooth finished indicators."

Thank you.."
TVS Apache RTR 180,4.5,The Prodigal Son ,4,"Excellent bike with adequate 17 bhp of power, i think its more than enough for a normal city commute, maintenance is pretty cheap as it is TVS. Yes i do agree with the vibration issue with this bike being more substantial, but in those 4 years with this bike i really didn't mind it still had the beans and was on par with other sub 200 cc bikes. Higher revs after 10000 rpm are useless buts its power delivery is more than linear upto 10000 rpm which i feel is really good. I'd suggest people to buy with ABS as the brakes are pretty much ok. The mileage is also pretty decent 30-35kmpl. The TVS tires frankly spoil the handling of this bike if at all you wanna change your tires i'd suggest Michelin pilot sport they are really good and help the bike to handle far better. There are compromises in every bike but before buying take a test drive understand your needs well and buy. Last but not the least i am actually fed up of TVS service so i have started servicing my own bike, its better.        "

It's quite impressive in terms of looks and performance, but I had some issues with the bike as I bought the vehicle in December 2020, problem arose in Mid Jan that the clutch switch was damaged I don't know how it got damaged because I ride vehicle sensibly. Further that I had the issue of rpm was fluctuating whenever. I was holding the throttle. These problems arose due to the poor servicing and worst unskilled mechanics in the service center at the TVs. They never do the servicing by heart. They will just clean your air filter and change the oil filter at the time of engine oil replacement. I have ridden 7800+ kilometers.

No other bike can attain 130 KMPH in this segment, but the built quality is very poor. i have faced some unusual issues with my bike, which clearly shows the poor built quality. The low range torque is bit lesser but once it crosses 4000 RPM, it pulls like anything. It gives you wings at 6000 RPM. The best part of Apache RTR is the breaking,  the response is awesome. even in 90's (speed) it stops at a single stroke. It gives a very good fuel economy at 45 KMPL. One more best part is the design, not too busy or very faded, nice tank scoops, belly pan, a very good visor which gives you wind protection at 100 KMPH also. With minor negatives (can be negligible) it is the best 160 CC bike.   "

There are no vibration issues on this machine. Also, it delivers good mileage. I don't notice any issues with the bike yet it has been a month now since I bought it. The LEW headlights are quite good and the upper beam helps you to see the heavy vehicle from a distance and talk about the breakings the ABS does the job exceptionally, but you have to keep in mind that using the rear brake directly may cause your bike to skid as it comes with the front ABS. You should use the front brake first. Overall the bike is quiet satisfactory, there is no other bike in this segment that handles all segments."

Yamaha FZ 25,4.4,All in all a power packed performer,4,"I am writing this review after using this bike for 2 months,on city roads, with a mileage of 1100kms.. till now I have not experienced any serious issue, the pick up is absolutely savage, the riding position is comfortable, overtaking looks like a cakewalk.. only add ons that the company can think about is the ABS and possibly a gear indicator on the display console. The headlights are decent enough, the looks are seriously attractive , they turn heads(i have a black colour bike).. overall it's totally worth every penny and arugaubly the best 250cc bike in this range. "
Yamaha FZ 25,4.4,The Demon.,5,"The seating position is awesome & the initial power is better than ns200, the Breaking is good. I think Abs is affordable. "
Yamaha FZ 25,4.4,Powerful street fighter with best in class ,5,"Powerful street fighter in segment of Rs. 1.50 lacks. No comparison with another 200 cc - 250 cc machines,that's why it is best in class. Excellent acceleration and also breaking system doing a good job. You extended your  love when its start and exhaust note is loud with lovely bass. Awesome Ride feeling in highway as well as in city traffic. In city traffic bike little bit hit up, but it's ok for the fz25. I never found any herder cons about this machine. Servicing cost are affordable and the most important is mileage, that approximately 35 to 38 kmph overall. "

Yamaha FZ 25,4.4,"Top End Speed low, Lack of 6th Gear.",3,"I did my bike's first service at 1050 km. After first service for few days engine was feeling  smooth but after some time it started to feel same as before. It starts vibration at 6000 rpm. My other concern is related to lack of 6th gear or ""top speed end"". If you ride this bike in city up-to 80-90km/hr than it feels ""OK"" but  If you ride on highway above 100km/h you feel like bike is struggling to get top end. So there should be 6th gear definitely. One of my good friend having Mahindra mojo(has 6th gear)  decided to ride along. Mojo was very smooth till 100km/h and higher in 5th gear but fz25 was struggling. No doubt Fz25 reaches 120+ km/hr but not that much smoothly. "

Yamaha R15S,4.6,Sporty-Agile-powerful.,4,"The riding position is aggressive, and if you don’t know how to ride such bikes, you will end up complaining about palm and back pains, I have taken this machine on 300 KM rides also, it wasn’t that bad, I mean that was okay, one can handle it. The engine is super refined, best you can get in 150CC segment, and above 7500 RPM when VVA kicks in, this machine goes brutal, the engine just roars. I have driven this machine for around 11000 KMs in total, even after driving it aggressively and shifting gears at redline, it gave me 37-40 KMPL, even after such aggressive driving, otherwise it can give around 45-48 KMPL. It’s easy to handle, and it is indeed a powerful machine. The slipper clutch is just amazing, it’s too easy to do rev-matching with this machine while downshifting, which I found tough with V2 and any other sports bike in this range. Things could be better ? - yes, first is Tyre, MRF zapper is not good enough, you don’t get enough confidence in rain or at higher speeds or while cornering due to loose Tyre. - I heard build quality is poor, but so far I haven’t faced such issues, it’s been a year and 11000KM! Things are just fine! - another point is, it’s weight, it’s light-weighted, so it’s agile, easy to control but at the same time that creates trouble at high speed, due to less weight, again you don’t feel much confident!"

Yamaha R15S,4.6,The best bike in its segment.,3,"Back in the day when the v2 was launched, I had no idea about it. But the bike made sure I knew all about it. The same could NOT be said about the v3. I was already hoping that Yamaha keeps everything intact in the v2 with minor upgrades trickling to it. I mean, the v2 was perfect. It would be really hard to top it. The benchmark will be very hard to beat. I was proven wrong when the Yamaha put out the v3. Like the v2 where it resembled the patriarch of the ‘R’ family, v3 ticks all the boxes in terms of carrying on the baton of heritage in terms of the looks. Especially the tail section. To the untrained eye, the tail from the R1 and the R15 would look the same. The front is, however, a different story. There are just too many panels for my taste. The LED headlamps look stupendous. And the fake RAM air intake does add to the aesthetic appeal."

Yamaha R15S,4.6,This one is amazing!,4,"Oh, it does! I am not gushing about the bike, it just does! Taking cues from its elder siblings, the R1 and the R6, the bike looks sharp and warrants a second look when moving on the road. The arrow-head shaped air vent between the LED lamps up-front makes for an aggressive face along with the sleek headlamps. The fairing itself has been designed nicely and fits very well in the overall scheme of things even though it doesn't go all the way down and leaves the engine slightly exposed. View it in profile, the sculpted fuel tank along with the upswept exhaust gives the bike an edgy look. The good thing is that there is a sense of balance. The design is not overwhelming or busy but at the same time, it is not too simple either that the bike is lost in a sea of two-wheelers on the road. But there is a grouse here! The fit and finish on the bike could have been better. The windscreen on our test bike had already started rattling and then, there are those ugly weld points on the Deltabox frame along with not-so-good plastics on the switchgear. It is slightly surprising because Yamaha models are known to have immaculate fit and finish. To begin with, the bike gets twin-LED headlamps, an LED tail lamp, a fully digital and comprehensive instrumentation console, and an assist and slipper clutch. The R15 model, which is sold in South East Asia, gets upside-down forks along with ABS which the Indian-spec model skips, understandably because costs would go up by a fair bit! We wish Yamaha offered ABS on the new-gen R15, even if as an option because the kind of performance it delivers, ABS should have been standard actually. You also get a USB charger and an array of optional equipment such as a Daytona exhaust and Metzeler rear tyre, all for a cost, of course. But the Metzelers should have been offered on both wheels."
Yamaha R15S,4.6,Not Fair,4,"Everything is nice in the bike, the looks are very good. Mileage is not as good as per the expectation."
Yamaha R15S,4.6,Love Yamaha,5,The best bike I ever have. It has sharp looks with great capabilities and features and I think it is the only bike which gives great performance with great mileage. Love this bike❤❤❤❤
Yamaha R15S,4.6,Super stylish.,5,"Yamaha R15 3.0 launched in India at Rs. 1.25 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). The 2018 Yamaha YZF-R15 V3 Power comes from the new 155 cc, liquid-cooled engine that produces 19 bhp at 10,000 rpm and 15 Nm of peak torque at 8500 rpm, which comes paired to a 6-speed gearbox. The engine runs on a higher compression ratio (11.6:1) and now gets a lightweight forged aluminum piston. It also comes with variable valves actuation (VVA) that aids in providing torque at low rpm.

Yamaha R15S,4.6,Beast look,5,Fabulous bike There world best bike according to its range its the best mantenace beast look best quality
Yamaha R15S,4.6,My R15 Version 3 Experience,5,"I have done a lot of touring on my R15 V3. I touch 10K in 7 odd months at least 7 to 8K is on highways. Initially, to get adapted to the bike you feel discomfort in knees, wrists, back soon but once your body adapts that maybe after 2 to 3K of ridding, you will enjoy riding due to it's committed racing posture. Even though top end speed is around 120 to 140 km/h you feel you are on racing mode a big bike kind of feel. Going in hilly terrain or s bends is a pleasure on R15, you can produce lean angles of 30 to 40 degrees with ease.. may you should install frame sliders before doing that. I don't think no other bike produced in India can challenge or come close to it in cornering. The refinement of the engine is amazing. The VVA kicks in on top rev helps you to get top speed from 100 to 140 with ease. The breaking is good. The only flip side for touring I find is it has SOHC piston which helps in quick acceleration to reach top speed, but to hold top speed you need to keep engine revving continuously you cant relax the throttle. This is something good with DOHC piston in CBR 250R where engine revs are more constant with momentum provided by DOHC, where you can be a bit relaxed on highway trips. Apart from this R15 V3 is a brilliant bike from Yamaha with so many specs in that price range."

That’s the verdict right there for you in the first line for the first time ever on BikeAdvice. And why not? At a time when most manufacturers continue to plaster shiny decals on their old motorcycles and organize proper “launch events” for them, coming out with a motorcycle that is better in every aspect than its previous iterations is not a small feat, especially when the first two avatars have remained the benchmark in the segment for a decade now."

Yamaha R15S,4.6,YAMAHA YZF-R15 V3 REVIEW by SUNDER BARANGE,5,"The Yamaha YZF-R15 is a specific flavour of motorcycle. It's built to take you through a set of corners with supreme poise and confidence but at the same time it's adept at handling daily commutes and the occasional highway jaunt, given its agressive riding position, But what remains unchanged about the YZF-R15, is its effectiveness as a beginner motorcycle, especially for those who are serious about improving their riding skills. That makes the YZF-R15 a must buy this side of Rs 1.5 lakh."

The bike is a little heavier than the previous model but the looks make up for it. Usually my first choice would have been R15 earlier, but now with such fierce competition in market, I'd surely give a second thought."

Yamaha FZ 25,4.4,Very good for Riding,4,"Yamaha FZ25 has a smooth engine, riding is comfortable & excellent feel to ride."
Yamaha FZ 25,4.4,Best Bike ,5,"The FZ25 is my first bike and I did a lot of planning before buying the bike. I browsed for nearly every possible bike in its category before shortlisting the Fz25. The bikes I shortlisted were Fz25 and Apache RTR 200 4v. Also looked for MT15 but later dropped the idea because of that extremely small pillion seat and single-channel ABS. Apache was another good option but then again in the past, I had a quite poor experience with TVS so dropped that too. Some also suggested me Gixxer 250 but the fact that it was nearly 30k premium over the FZ25, also I didn't need that much power.  The Fz25 seemed to be a perfect fit for me. It has a nice punchy engine, more than adequate for daily commutes. The torque band is also quite wide and the bike also pulls quite neatly through traffic. Overtakes are such a breeze in this thing. For the first few hundred kilometers, I felt the engine is a bit buzzy but the eased off after the first service.  The gearbox is also slick. The need for 6th gear is obviously felt as the 5th gear also seems a power gear instead of being a cruising gear. I never felt the bike to be underpowered in my daily driving routine. I'm also not a fast rider, I prefer to ride the bike in a comfortable manner. The seating position is extremely comfortable and the suspension is also beautifully soft. It just glides over bumps and potholes... Said that I still feel the front is just too soft for hard cornering... The pillion seat is set a bit high but now that's because to give the rider a feel of sitting on the bike rather than on the bike...Overall I would say this is a bike for people who want a comfortable city carver and those who don't like being hustled around. And to be honest it looks pretty beautiful too. And it turns heads wherever it goes."

We spent a day hustling this near MotoGP-spec Ducati superbike at the Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia. And we came back overwhelmed with the V4 engine's performance and the bike's overall handling. It is the most powerful road-legal homologated superbike in the world, and it's the first production Ducati to use a four-cylinder engine. After spending a few track sessions with the Ducati Panigale V4 S at the Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia, we can say with conviction that Ducati has made a superbike which can make you feel like you have much better skills on a racetrack than what you actually have.

Ducati Streetfighter V2,4,Amazing Performance Bike,3,"Having previously owned a Panigale 899 and a Panigale V2, I have a soft spot for the baby Panigale platform, and I've always found it to be an easier bike to ride hard and enjoy on the road than the V4. The Streetfighter V2 is based on the same engine, chassis, and technology platform as the Panigale V2, but it isn't the same, aside from the obvious changes to a naked machine. To be honest, I adore the Streetfighter V2's design. It's aggressive, bold, and everything I want in a naked bike, though to be honest, I'd like a little less plastic and a little more carbon for the price - and no, I don't want to add some wings. Although the cockpit is a little small, the dash is easy to use and the riding posture is extremely lovely and roomy, with those big, wide 'bars allowing a nice, upright riding stance. It's worth noting, though, that while it's spacious, the seat height is somewhat high if you're on the shorter side of the spectrum. Heating issues are there to accompany you in city traffic and now it's even worse. At last, the looks of this beauty are incomparable it's a pugnacious little machine and not to forget it's a crazy eye candy with its angry eyes."

Ducati Panigale V4,4.7,The Panigale V4 - Most Powerful,4,"The Panigale V4 is one of the most powerful track weapon and the road-legal performance motorcycle which can give goosebumps each and every gear shifts the way the bike handles and the adrenaline rush given by the 1103cc 90° Desmocideci Stradale V4 engine puts a tremendous 214hp(215.5hp in 2022 variant) at the peak of 15k redline, this Italian beauty is a hell of a beast. The engine is becoming smoother and better year after year and Ducati is trying to add more updated electronics and shedding weights for an even better bike this bike is just blown everyone's mind in 2018 EICMA shows after Desmosedici RR which is a long time ago they give a big bold v4 engine which is a huge appreciation for Ducati and a big step against the rivals. If you want to unleash the full potential of the bike just install the Akrapovic full system race exhaust and flash ECU then a couple of mods like carbon fibres, etc then you're good to go. And there are some negative points too like no fuel gauge, heating issues, no cruise control, and the big fact that it's expensive in every aspect including price, maintenance, parts, etc. If you want a really fun thrill bike to ride at weekends or on track or in street or on the highway I recommend the Panigale V4 to get because it has its own personal characteristics and at the end of the day you might know what I meant about the bike."

Such a great riding experience, never had any problems in my 1000 KMS ride within a week. No vibrations and unnecessary noise even when riding at 100 KMPH. Engine heat is an issue when riding within the city. No issues during long rides. Exhaust sound: waiting for the company to advise on removing the DB Killer (as of now a strict no to this). I rode 200 KMS in a stretch and never had any back pain (I have issues with my L5). Only recommendation is to have some extra padding for the seats. Literally rules the road on a highway ride."

Jawa Perak,4.6,Most attractive bike ever,4,"The look of the new Jawa Perak is quite attractive. It gets a floating single-seat standard with the integrated taillight. Round headlamps, single-seat, black wire-spoke wheels, bar-end mirrors, small fenders, and slash-cut exhaust give it the look of a classic bobber bike. The bike also has a rear seat option."

Jawa Perak,4.6,Will attract  those who value aesthetics,5,"The Perak is simply a modified version of the normal Jawa, but instead of the rear subframe, it has an interesting and striking cantilevered seat. The seat's tan colour contrasts wonderfully with the bike's matte black motif and gold pinstriping, and it is fastened to the main frame by a sturdy-looking sheet of metal. In the back of the seat is a stylish round LED brake, and behind that is a sizable fender with nothing but air above it."
Jawa Perak,4.6,Good Looking Bike,4,"A deeper examination of Jawa Perak reveals that the finish levels are actually a touch higher than the most recent Jawa models. On cold mornings, the speedometer still collects moisture, and because of its poorly chosen placement, the rider is unable to read the lower part of the gauge. Additionally, the rear indicators' exposed cables are tacky."

Next is the rusting problem. They said they will replace it too. Next is discomfort during riding. The seat is so stiff. Your backbone will be at risk if you drive for longer distances."
Jawa,4.3,Powerful bike.,5,This bike offers a great fuel economy and a powerful engine.

Jawa,4.3,A classic-looking bike ever,4,"Jawa 300 is the perfect bike for average-height people. If you are looking for a properly classic-looking bike, the Jawa is your best bet right now. This bike hits all the right nostalgic notes at first glance itself. The built quality and the riding comfort are a sheer pleasure in addition to the awe it gets fellow riders of other bike enthusiasts. "
Jawa,4.3,Comfortable Ergonomics,4,"When traveling a long distance, the functional design of the Jawa 300 is the most significant factor in determining the rider's comfort. Another advantage of the Jawa 300 is that it has a comfortable riding posture. The footpegs are set slightly forward, and the handlebar is quite high. So you sit quite upright, which is comfortable for most Indians."
Jawa,4.3,Jawa 300 - Best Touring Bike,4,"The Jawa 300 can be converted into a good touring bike. It also has a fuel level indicator, which most retro bikes lack. However, because the bike is new to the Indian market, the reliability factor is still unknown."
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Easy Handling,4,"This bike has a long handle, sitting is comfortable, easy handling, smoothness even at higher acceleration, and the looks are stunning looks. "
Jawa,4.3,It has poor paint quality,3,"Jawa 300 ground clearance is not going to be a problem as per me but go slow when you are riding with a pillion. Its paint quality is not good, you can get scratches so easily, So you have to do lamination or ceramic coating as soon as you buy it. Its mileage is around 37 to 40 Kmpl for me."
Jawa,4.3,Jawa gives a premium feel,4,"Jawa 300 has an awesome braking system. Everything in this bike is excellent and it suits me perfectly, but I waited for nearly four months after booking, and the riding experience was kick-ass. It has an authentic appeal and offers a comfortable riding position. As for quality, all of the components on the Jawa feel premium."
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Everything Is Better With Jawa 42,4,Riding a Jawa 42 makes you feel like you're the owner of the road you're riding on. It catches the maximum attention and the overall experience boosts your confidence. Everything is better with Jawa 42.

Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Good Performance Bike,4,It is a good performance and stylish bike with a good riding experience and power.
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Jawa 42 One Of The Best Cruiser Bike,3,"JAWA 42 is one of the best cruiser bikes in the Indian market its power-weight ratio is very awesome and the power delivery is very good. I can notice some light vibration in the high revs, but it has no issue and some serious issues occur at high speed. It crosses the speed of 120kmph the gasket, and o-rings are torn and engine oil is leaked. Also, serious battery problems LED to a lack of power delivery, and also this affects the horn. The bites of the breaks are quite good, and the front brakes are good as compared to the back. The instrument cluster gives an adequate amount of information.  "
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Low Ground Clearance ( Potential Issue),3,"It's a very good performance bike, but the only issue is the ground clearance of this bike, which is very low, making it less suitable for Indian roads, rain puddles, high-speed breakers, etc. The overall bike is nice, go for it."
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Jawa 42 - Stylish,5,"The Jawa 42, is self-assertive, more aggressive interpretation of the Jawa DNA, featuring a trim front fender, a smaller headlight paired with an offset analogue-cum-digital speedo pod, wide tracker-style handlebars, and a youthful paint scheme with gold accents. Both bikes taper off gracefully into an old school rear end and are thankfully outfitted with small and stylish indicators that blend in seamlessly with the overall design."
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Cheapest bike in the segment,5,"Jawa 42 is the cheapest bike in the company's lineup. This bike has a retro theme and sports dual exhaust pipes, analog speedometer and spoke wheels. The riding experience is good. I traveled 250 kms on my first ride and it has a good pickup. There is no back pain issue on long journeys."
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Claasy Look - Jawa 42,4,"Getting into a rhythm with the road was simple-according to my experience diving into corners with jawa 42 was  with fluid elegance and speed. The brand-new, dual-cradle frame was built around the engine and combines the greatest features of traditional design with cutting-edge engineering to provide an exceptional ride and handling. Despite the less than optimal road surface, the carefully calibrated suspension performs a fair job of keeping both wheels on the ground. The front brakes with ABS are outstanding in feel and modulation, giving you the assurance to push the limits."
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Jawa 42 - Exceptional Ride,4,"Getting into a rhythm with the road was simple-according to my experience diving into corners with jawa 42 was  with fluid elegance and speed.

The front brakes with ABS are outstanding in feel and modulation, giving you the assurance to push the limits."
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Attractive and strong,4,I am using Jawa 42 for the last 1 year my writing experience with this bike has been very good. I love the build quality of this bike.

Jawa Forty Two,4.3,It has excellent power,4,Jawa 42 gives a superb riding experience. I'm trying to replace the seat of my bike. The seat is looking superb but comfort is harder. Its performance is the massive and excellent power delivery. This is an awesome bike for long rides also. Jawa only gives helmet and crash guard. Accessories are not available in the after-market.
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Jawa's great bike ever,4,"Jawa 42 is in discussion among bike lovers due to its retro look and modern features. It looks like a modern classic roadster. It retains the retro feeling of a roadster fused with modern styling cues. It is an entry-level bike from Jawa. The mileage figures are not out yet, but we expect it to be around 40 Kmpl."
Jawa Perak,4.6,Ravishingly but has Drawbacks,4,"Such a startling design brings its share of negatives. the riding position is painful beacause the sitting is low at 750 mm with limitd suspension travel from its neatly hidden rear shock, the Perak’s ride quality can also be quite punishing over bumpy roads. Another drawback is that ground clearance has dropped to 145mm and the bike will scrape over sharp speed breakers if you are not careful."
Jawa Perak,4.6,Best refinement and comfort. ,4,"This bike is new in the market, but it competes with the Royal Enfield meteor 350. The refinement of the bike is great. Material quality should be improved. "
Jawa Perak,4.6,Not worth the price,3,"I think it is brave for the company to have taken such a hard-line approach to style, even though the result compromises practicality. This is a strict single-seater, and those large panels on the side have no significant storage space apart from holding a small tools and some papers. It is not like the Perak is loaded with features either. Dual-channel ABS is standard but beyond that, things are quite stringent"
Jawa Forty Two,4.3,Good Bike,4,"Overall decent and amazing ride. The bike is super a power full pickup and is comfortable sitting, The Jawa service cost is also decent."
Jawa Perak,4.6,A powerful performance,5,"Jawa Perak offers a good amount of power and the delivery is relatively flat. But push the motor, and it is ready to play ball! On the highway, the Perak feels punchy enough to go the long distance, but the problem lies with its ride quality and seating position which tires out the rider."
Jawa Perak,4.6,It has a bobber design,5,"The new Jawa Perak will feature a blacked-out theme along with a single seat coloured in tan, and black coloured engine, exhaust and spoke wheels. The instrument console will feature a minimal design. The bike really increased the hype due to its bobber design as Jawa is the only one to offer a bobber body type in this price segment."
Jawa Perak,4.6,Good Performance,4,The bikes look so good than others. But the mileage is very low. but safety and performance are best. The comfort is to the next level.
Jawa Perak,4.6,Good Design And Comfort,4,"It's more of youth bikes. Like not a Cruiser or a sports bike. Just kind of a mix. It has a very classy look and feels good when riding with a unique design. But it is a bit like backdated in terms of the speedometer, no navigation system rear sitting style is bad. Its millage is pretty impressive. One suggestion is that when you ride this kind of motorcycle please don't think much about petrol then it will kill the joy of riding."
Jawa Perak,4.6,"Overall, A Good Bike",5,"Overall, a good bike will balance these factors to suit the rider's needs and preferences. It's essential to conduct thorough research and, if possible, test-ride the bike to ensure it meets your expectations. Always consider your skill level, budget, and the type of terrain you'll be riding on when choosing a bike. Size and Fit: Finding the right size and fit is crucial for a comfortable and efficient ride. A bike that suits your body type and riding style is essential for an enjoyable experience. Purpose: Consider the intended use of the bike. Different types of bikes cater to various purposes, such as road biking, mountain biking, commuting, or touring."
Jawa Perak,4.6,It is the best bike,4,"It is the best bike I have ever seen with the best performance, excellent comfort, and an awesome look and system."
Jawa Perak,4.6,A Balanced Blend Of Classic And Modern,4,"The Jawa Perak earns a solid 4/5 for its classic-meets-modern design, exuding rugged sophistication with a matte black finish and bobber stance. Its 334cc engine delivers ample power and torque, though a touch more could enhance highway prowess. Comfortable handling and well-tuned suspension strike a good balance. Features like ABS, LED lighting, and digital instrumentation blend well with the vintage charm. The bike offers good value for its price, boasting a standout cruiser experience. A few tweaks could elevate its performance further. In 10 lines, the Jawa Perak is a unique and appealing choice in the cruiser segment with its distinct style, notable power, comfortable ride, and modern features. However, minor improvements could refine its performance."
Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX,4.6,Comfy riding position and good drive,4,"Kawasaki ninja 1000 is a very good looking bike,with aggressive styling that does justice to the ninja tag.The good looking twin headlights give it a better look.I used it for almost 2 years and then sold it to my friend.The bike gave a good average at first but it started gradually decreasing as every vehicle does.The bike had good seating.The rear brakes often got down and had to get thim fixed.But the look and seating more than made up for it."
Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX,4.6,Wonderful,4,"Kawasaki Ninja 300 was like a dream come true to me. The day I bought it, I become the centre of attraction every time I go on road. Initially, I found it pretty heavy to ride in traffic. But after spending some time with this power machine, I become familiar and now I can ride it like any other bike.It is a perfect practical performance bike which can be used for both touring and commuting and a good performer on the track. The engine is refined and vibration free. The gear shifts are more torquier and smooth which makes riding more comfortable. As you all know, it’s not built for higher fuel efficiency, but it provides more mileage than the old 250R. I have got an overall 26 km/l and it’s a good digit for a sports bike. The acceleration is very impressive. The only thing that makes a rider turn away is its price ta Though the seating position of bike is sporty but it is comfortable too. The best riding experience comes when you cross 6000RPM and it is best experience in the 300 class. I personally never found any problem in this bike."

It has great performance and lightweight chassis improves the riding quality and handling, great overall performance and power. Nice fuel economy as compared to other superbikes (somewhere around 20.5kmpl). Can give up to 200km/h of speed without vibrations. However, maintenance cost is quite high and the availability of showrooms/service centers lacks. Overall, the best option in the superbikes category especially for college students."

Kawasaki W800 Street,3,Wonderful Bike,3,The bike is inspired by the Jawa and the silencer engine. The refinement is good but the handling quality should be improved by the Kawasaki motors to run the bike in this segment.

Kawasaki Versys 650,4,Awesome Looks,4,"One of the best bike according to the looks.

And nothing will beat putting your head down and bursting across one of London's bridges, bathed in spring sunshine, to brighten your Monday morning; however horrible your job is."
Kawasaki Versys 650,4,Highway Cruiser,3,"Owned Versys 650 2019 model and clocked 14,000 km on it before selling it in 2021. Versys 650 is a fuzz bike and is easy to maintain in long run. Extremely comfortable bike to ride on, did close to 1000 km in a day with zero fatigue and back pain thanks to the very upright seating position and wide seat.

Kawasaki KLX 110,3,Kawasaki KLX110 Great Bike For Beginners,3,"The Kawasaki KLX110 is a great bike, but it is great for beginners as this is lightweight easy to handle, and small engine, which is not much powerful.

Kawasaki Vulcan S,4.7,Great motorcycle cruiser from kawasaki,5,"This bike has very good handling, ride quality is better than Harley 750 in any manner. the only possible issue is the seat which can hurt your butt on long routes ""however this can changed for very small amount"".Vibration level is also low in high gear at nominal speeds. The bike feels more like a sports bike at times with how the throttle responds. "
Kawasaki Vulcan S,4.7,"Great ""Sports Cruiser""",4,Great Sports Cruiser and a Head turner. It is surprisingly highly maneuverable compared to its size. One issue though is its low 130 mm Ground clearance which often creates issues around Speed bumps in Cities.

The level of finish and quality on the H2 is some of the highest I’ve ever seen on a production road bike. Some won’t like the aggressive fuelling and power delivery in the first few gears, but then those people shouldn’t be considering a £22,000 supercharged sportsbike. If you want to chase lap times get a ZX-10R, but if you want one of the most exciting road bikes ever built, then step forward, and get in the queue."

Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R,4.4,"Now, a question cannot pose",4,"Now, a question cannot pose as a commandment, let alone a seemingly blasphemous one, but do bear with me. Although, really, in one way the Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R seems to exist for little else than to enable Jonathan Rea to win one WSBK championship after another (six so far), creating history as they go along together.

This bike comes with high speed and many good features. This bike offers comfortable riding with safety. I am using it for racing purposes and I like this bike so much.
Suzuki Gixxer SF 250,4.5,Best Bike Of The Year And Award Winner In 2020,4,"Well, I am the 1st buyer of SF 250 MotoGP in my state. There is no better bike than SF 250 in the quarter-litre sportbike segment. This bike is solely responsible for uprooting Honda CBR from the Indian market. As I have owned a CBR 250 also, I can easily say SF 250 is much better. The engine is smoother and more refined, looks much better than CBR and KTM RCS which look too bad after the BS6 update. Only R15 V3 is close to the looks but v3 is ridiculously expensive as a 150 cc bike. Coming to the performance, it is gonna be 2 yrs now from the date of purchase n this bike never had any major or minor breakdown apart from the battery issue in lockdown. It can be easily used for your daily city rides. With a ground clearance of 165 mm, it absorbs the bumps smoothly. N on a track or even on a highway, u can touch 150 easily on the speedometer. I have even gone to the beachside of my state riding it for 4 hrs. and has not felt any pain. With the stock tyres of MRF REVZ, it is the best bike as RCS also come with the same stock tyre now after the bs6 update n r15 v3 and even ninja 300 have MRF zappers as stock tyres which will last for hardly 2 yrs. The only bike that is better than it is RR 310 which has become a dream bike after the BS6 update but the only reason I didn't buy it was the unavailability of the Blue colour. Finally, I must conclude that my biggest satisfaction came when my mom could sit on the SF 250 comfortably that she could never do on the CBR for 6 yrs."
